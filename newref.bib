@inproceedings{Riccio2020bg,
	abstract = {With the increasing adoption of Deep Learning (DL) for critical tasks, such as autonomous driving, the evaluation of the quality of systems that rely on DL has become crucial. Once trained, DL systems produce an output for any arbitrary numeric vector provided as input, regardless of whether it is within or outside the validity domain of the system under test. Hence, the quality of such systems is determined by the intersection between their validity domain and the regions where their outputs exhibit a misbehaviour. In this paper, we introduce the notion of frontier of behaviours, i.e., the inputs at which the DL system starts to misbehave. If the frontier of misbehaviours is outside the validity domain of the system, the quality check is passed. Otherwise, the inputs at the intersection represent quality deficiencies of the system. We developed DeepJanus, a search-based tool that generates frontier inputs for DL systems. The experimental results obtained for the lane keeping component of a self-driving car show that the frontier of a well trained system contains almost exclusively unrealistic roads that violate the best practices of civil engineering, while the frontier of a poorly trained one includes many valid inputs that point to serious deficiencies of the system.},

	abstract = { Existing mutation techniques produce vast numbers of equivalent, trivial, and redundant mutants. Selective mutation strategies aim to reduce the inherent redundancy of full mutation analysis to obtain most of its benefit for a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, recent research has shown that there is no fixed selective mutation strategy that is effective across a broad range of programs; the utility (i.e., usefulness) of a mutant produced by a given mutation operator varies greatly across programs.  This paper hypothesizes that mutant utility, in terms of equivalence, triviality, and dominance, can be predicted by incorporating context information from the program in which the mutant is embedded. Specifically, this paper (1) explains the intuition behind this hypothesis with a motivational example, (2) proposes an approach for modeling program context using a program's abstract syntax tree, and (3) proposes and evaluates a series of program-context models for predicting mutant utility. The results for 129 mutation operators show that program context information greatly increases the ability to predict mutant utility. The results further show that it is important to consider program context for individual mutation operators rather than mutation operator groups. },

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications including autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics. To reduce the residual risk for unexpected DNN behaviour and provide evidence for their trustworthy operation, DNNs should be thoroughly tested. The DeepFault whitebox DNN testing approach presented in our paper addresses this challenge by employing suspiciousness measures inspired by fault localization to establish the hit spectrum of neurons and identify suspicious neurons whose weights have not been calibrated correctly and thus are considered responsible for inadequate DNN performance. DeepFault also uses a suspiciousness-guided algorithm to synthesize new inputs, from correctly classified inputs, that increase the activation values of suspicious neurons. Our empirical evaluation on several DNN instances trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets shows that DeepFault is effective in identifying suspicious neurons. Also, the inputs synthesized by DeepFault closely resemble the original inputs, exercise the identified suspicious neurons and are highly adversarial.},

	abstract = {Recent software systems usually feature an automated failure reporting system, with which a huge number of failing traces are collected every day. In order to prioritize fault diagnosis, failing traces due to the same fault are expected to be grouped together. Previous methods, by hypothesizing that similar failing traces imply the same fault, cluster failing traces based on the literal trace similarity, which we call trace proximity. However, since a fault can be triggered in many ways, failing traces due to the same fault can be quite different. Therefore, previous methods actually group together traces exhibiting similar behaviors, like similar branch coverage, rather than traces due to the same fault. In this paper, we propose a new type of  failure proximity, called R-Proximity, which regards two failing traces as similar if they suggest roughly the same fault location. The fault location each failing case suggests is automatically obtained with Sober, an existing statistical debugging tool. We show that with R-Proximity, failing traces due to the same fault can be grouped together. In addition, we find that R-Proximity is helpful for statistical debugging: It can help developers interpret and utilize the statistical debugging result. We illustrate the usage of R-Proximity with a case study on the grep program and some experiments on the Siemens suite, and the result clearly demonstrates the advantage of R-Proximity over trace proximity.},

	abstract = { Probabilistic symbolic execution aims at quantifying the probability of reaching program events of interest assuming that program inputs follow given probabilistic distributions. The technique collects constraints on the inputs that lead to the target events and analyzes them to quantify how likely it is for an input to satisfy the constraints. Current techniques either handle only linear constraints or only support continuous distributions using a ``discretization'' of the input domain, leading to imprecise and costly results. We propose an iterative distribution-aware sampling approach to support probabilistic symbolic execution for arbitrarily complex mathematical constraints and continuous input distributions. We follow a compositional approach, where the symbolic constraints are decomposed into sub-problems whose solution can be solved independently. At each iteration the convergence rate of the com- putation is increased by automatically refocusing the analysis on estimating the sub-problems that mostly affect the accuracy of the results, as guided by three different ranking strategies. Experiments on publicly available benchmarks show that the proposed technique improves on previous approaches in terms of scalability and accuracy of the results. },

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new and very simple search methodology called Late Acceptance Hill-Climbing (LAHC). It is a local search algorithm, which accepts non-improving moves when a candidate cost function is better than it was a number of iterations before. This number appears as a single algorithmic input parameter which determines the total processing time of the search procedure. The properties of this method are experimentally studied in this paper with a range of Travelling Salesman and Exam Timetabling benchmark problems. Also, we present a fair comparison of LAHC with well-known search techniques, which employ a cooling schedule: Simulated Annealing (SA), Threshold Accepting (TA) and the Great Deluge Algorithm (GDA). In addition, we discuss the success of the method in winning an international competition to automatically solve the Magic Square problem. Our experiments have shown that the LAHC approach is simple, easy to implement and yet is an effective search procedure. For most of the studied instances (especially for the large sized ones), its average performance is better than competitor methods. Moreover, the LAHC approach has an additional advantage (in contrast to the above cooling schedule based methods) in its scale independence. We present an example where the rescaling of a cost function in the Travelling Salesman Problem dramatically deteriorates the performance of three cooling schedule based techniques, but has absolutely no influence upon the performance of LAHC.},

	abstract = { Android ecosystem is heavily fragmented. The numerous combinations of different device models and operating system versions make it impossible for Android app developers to exhaustively test their apps. As a result, various compatibility issues arise, causing poor user experience. However, little is known on the characteristics of such fragmentation-induced compatibility issues and no mature tools exist to help developers quickly diagnose and fix these issues. To bridge the gap, we conducted an empirical study on 191 real-world compatibility issues collected from popular open-source Android apps. Our study characterized the symptoms and root causes of compatibility issues, and disclosed that the patches of these issues exhibit common patterns. With these findings, we propose a technique named FicFinder to automatically detect compatibility issues in Android apps. FicFinder performs static code analysis based on a model that captures Android APIs as well as their associated context by which compatibility issues are triggered. FicFinder reports actionable debugging information to developers when it detects potential issues. We evaluated FicFinder with 27 large-scale open-source Android apps. The results show that FicFinder can precisely detect compatibility issues in these apps and uncover previously-unknown issues. },

	abstract = {Developing and integrating software in the automotive industry is a complex task and
requires extensive testing. An important cost factor in testing and debugging is the
time required to analyze failing tests. In the context of regression testing, usually,
large numbers of tests fail due to a few underlying faults. Clustering failing tests
with respect to their underlying faults can, therefore, help in reducing the required
analysis time. In this paper, we propose a clustering technique to group failing hardware-in-the-loop
tests based on non-code-based features, retrieved from three different sources. To
effectively reduce the analysis effort, the clustering tool selects a representative
test for each cluster. Instead of analyzing all failing tests, testers only inspect
the representative tests to find the underlying faults. We evaluated the effectiveness
and efficiency of our solution in a major automotive company using 86 regression test
runs, 8743 failing tests, and 1531 faults. The results show that utilizing our clustering
tool, testers can reduce the analysis time more than 60% and find more than 80% of
the faults only by inspecting the representative tests.},

@article{Faloutsos1995wx,
	abstract = {A very promising idea for fast searching in traditional and multimedia databases is
to map objects into points in k-d space, using k feature-extraction functions, provided
by a domain expert [25]. Thus, we can subsequently use highly fine-tuned spatial access
methods (SAMs), to answer several types of queries, including the 'Query By Example'
type (which translates to a range query); the 'all pairs' query (which translates
to a spatial join [8]); the nearest-neighbor or best-match query, etc.However, designing
feature extraction functions can be hard. It is relatively easier for a domain expert
to assess the similarity/distance of two objects. Given only the distance information
though, it is not obvious how to map objects into points.This is exactly the topic
of this paper. We describe a fast algorithm to map objects into points in some k-dimensional
space (k is user-defined), such that the dis-similarities are preserved. There are
two benefits from this mapping: (a) efficient retrieval, in conjunction with a SAM,
as discussed before and (b) visualization and data-mining: the objects can now be
plotted as points in 2-d or 3-d space, revealing potential clusters, correlations
among attributes and other regularities that data-mining is looking for.We introduce
an older method from pattern recognition, namely, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)
[51]; although unsuitable for indexing, we use it as yardstick for our method. Then,
we propose a much faster algorithm to solve the problem in hand, while in addition
it allows for indexing. Experiments on real and synthetic data indeed show that the
proposed algorithm is significantly faster than MDS, (being linear, as opposed to
quadratic, on the database size N), while it manages to preserve distances and the
overall structure of the data-set.},

@article{Lee2021ua,
	abstract = {While dependency analysis is foundational to much program analysis, many techniques have limited scalability and handle only monolingual systems. We present a novel dependency analysis technique that aims to approximate program dependency from a relatively small number of perturbed executions. Our technique, MOAD (Modeling Observation-based Approximate Dependency), reformulates program dependency as the likelihood that one program element is dependent on another (instead of a Boolean relationship). MOAD generates program variants by deleting parts of the source code and executing them while observing the impact. MOAD thus infers a model of program dependency that captures the relationship between the modification and observation points. We evaluate MOAD using program slices obtained from the resulting probabilistic dependency models. Compared to the existing observation-based backward slicing technique, ORBS, MOAD requires only 18.6% of the observations, while the resulting slices are only 12% larger on average. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of the observation-based forward slices. Unlike ORBS, which inherently computes backward slices, MOAD's model's dependences can be traversed in either direction allowing us to easily compute forward slices. In comparison to the static forward slice, MOAD only misses deleting 0--6 lines (median 0), while excessively deleting 0--37 lines (median 8) from the slice.},

The set-covering problem is to minimize cTx subject to Ax ≥ e and x binary. We compare the value of the objective function at a feasible solution found by a simple greedy heuristic to the true optimum. It turns out that the ratio between the two grows at most logarithmically in the largest column sum of A. When all the components of $c^{T}$ are the same, our result reduces to a theorem established previously by Johnson and Lovasz.},

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) systems are increasingly applied to safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving cars. It is of significant importance to ensure the reliability and robustness of DL systems. Existing testing methodologies always fail to include rare inputs in the testing dataset and exhibit low neuron coverage. In this paper, we propose DLFuzz, the first differential fuzzing testing framework to guide DL systems exposing incorrect behaviors. DLFuzz keeps minutely mutating the input to maximize the neuron coverage and the prediction difference between the original input and the mutated input, without manual labeling effort or cross-referencing oracles from other DL systems with the same functionality. We present empirical evaluations on two well-known datasets to demonstrate its efficiency. Compared with DeepXplore, the state-of-the-art DL whitebox testing framework, DLFuzz does not require extra efforts to find similar functional DL systems for cross-referencing check, but could generate 338.59% more adversarial inputs with 89.82% smaller perturbations, averagely obtain 2.86% higher neuron coverage, and save 20.11% time consumption.},

The programmer typically runs the program on some test cases, and if and when they run correctly, the program is considered to be correct.We know that many difficult problems are associated with testing. One such problem is that it is a fundamental part of the testing process to require the ability to infer properties of a program by observing the program's behavior on selected inputs. The most common property that one hopes to infer through testing is correctness. But unless the program is run on the entire input domain, there are infinitely many programs which produce the correct output on the selected inputs, but produce incorrect output for some other element of the domain.},

@inproceedings{Smith2015ko,
	abstract = { Automated program repair has shown promise for reducing the significant manual effort debugging requires. This paper addresses a deficit of earlier evaluations of automated repair techniques caused by repairing programs and evaluating generated patches' correctness using the same set of tests. Since tests are an imperfect metric of program correctness, evaluations of this type do not discriminate between correct patches and patches that overfit the available tests and break untested but desired functionality. This paper evaluates two well-studied repair tools, GenProg and TrpAutoRepair, on a publicly available benchmark of bugs, each with a human-written patch. By evaluating patches using tests independent from those used during repair, we find that the tools are unlikely to improve the proportion of independent tests passed, and that the quality of the patches is proportional to the coverage of the test suite used during repair. For programs that pass most tests, the tools are as likely to break tests as to fix them. However, novice developers also overfit, and automated repair performs no worse than these developers. In addition to overfitting, we measure the effects of test suite coverage, test suite provenance, and starting program quality, as well as the difference in quality between novice-developer-written and tool-generated patches when quality is assessed with a test suite independent from the one used for patch generation. },

	abstract = { The name of a unit test helps developers to understand the purpose and scenario of the test, and test names support developers when navigating amongst sets of unit tests. When unit tests are generated automatically, however, they tend to be given non-descriptive names such as ``test0'', which provide none of the benefits a descriptive name can give a test. The underlying challenge is that automatically generated tests typically do not represent real scenarios and have no clear purpose other than covering code, which makes naming them di cult. In this paper, we present an automated approach which generates descriptive names for automatically generated unit tests by summarizing API-level coverage goals. The tests are optimized to be short, descriptive of the test, have a clear relation to the covered code under test, and allow developers to uniquely distinguish tests in a test suite. An empirical evaluation with 47 participants shows that developers agree with the synthesized names, and the synthesized names are equally descriptive as manually written names. Study participants were even more accurate and faster at matching code and tests with synthesized names compared to manually derived names. },

	abstract = { A notable class of techniques for automatic program repair is known as semantics-based. Such techniques, e.g., Angelix, infer semantic specifications via symbolic execution, and then use program synthesis to construct new code that satisfies those inferred specifications. However, the obtained specifications are naturally incomplete, leaving the synthesis engine with a difficult task of synthesizing a general solution from a sparse space of many possible solutions that are consistent with the provided specifications but that do not necessarily generalize. We present S3, a new repair synthesis engine that leverages programming-by-examples methodology to synthesize high-quality bug repairs. The novelty in S3 that allows it to tackle the sparse search space to create more general repairs is three-fold: (1) A systematic way to customize and constrain the syntactic search space via a domain-specific language, (2) An efficient enumeration- based search strategy over the constrained search space, and (3) A number of ranking features based on measures of the syntactic and semantic distances between candidate solutions and the original buggy program. We compare S3's repair effectiveness with state-of-the-art synthesis engines Angelix, Enumerative, and CVC4. S3 can successfully and correctly fix at least three times more bugs than the best baseline on datasets of 52 bugs in small programs, and 100 bugs in real-world large programs. },

	abstract = {It is said 90% of faults that survive manufacturer's testing procedures are complex. That is, the corresponding bug fix contains multiple changes. Higher order mutation testing is used to study defect interactions and their impact on software testing for fault finding. We adopt a multi-objective Pareto optimal approach using Monte Carlo sampling, genetic algorithms and genetic programming to search for higher order mutants which are both hard-to-kill and realistic. The space of complex faults (higher order mutants) is much larger than that of traditional first order mutations which correspond to simple faults, nevertheless search based approaches make this scalable. The problems of non-determinism and efficiency are overcome. Easy to detect faults may become harder to detect when they interact and impossible to detect single faults may be brought to light when code contains two such faults. We use strong typing and BNF grammars in search based mutation testing to find examples of both in ancient heavily optimised every day C code.},

All of the results from this investigation support the validity of the coupling effect.

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNN) have been shown to be notoriously brittle to small perturbations in their input data. This problem is analogous to the over-fitting problem in test-based program synthesis and automatic program repair, which is a consequence of the incomplete specification, i.e., the limited tests or training examples, that the program synthesis or repair algorithm has to learn from. Recently, test generation techniques have been successfully employed to augment existing specifications of intended program behavior, to improve the generalizability of program synthesis and repair. Inspired by these approaches, in this paper, we propose a technique that re-purposes software testing methods, specifically mutation-based fuzzing, to augment the training data of DNNs, with the objective of enhancing their robustness. Our technique casts the DNN data augmentation problem as an optimization problem. It uses genetic search to generate the most suitable variant of an input data to use for training the DNN, while simultaneously identifying opportunities to accelerate training by skipping augmentation in many instances. We instantiate this technique in two tools, Sensei and Sensei-SA, and evaluate them on 15 DNN models spanning 5 popular image data-sets. Our evaluation shows that Sensei can improve the robust accuracy of the DNN, compared to the state of the art, on each of the 15 models, by upto 11.9% and 5.5% on average. Further, Sensei-SA can reduce the average DNN training time by 25%, while still improving robust accuracy.},

	abstract = { Automated UI testing suffers from fragility due to continuous -although minor- changes in the UI of applications. Such fragility has been shown especially for the web domain, though no clear evidence is available for mobile applications. Our goal is to perform an exploratory assessment of the extent and causes of the fragiliy of UI automated tests for mobile applications. For this purpose, we analyzed a small test suite -that we developed using five different testing frameworks for an Android application (K-9 Mail) and observed the changes induced in the tests by the evolution of the UI. We found that up to 75% of code-based tests, and up to 100% of image recognition tests, had to be adapted because of the changes induced by the evolution of the application between two different versions. In addition we identified the main causes of such fragility: changes of identifiers, text or graphics, removal or relocation of elements, activity flow variation, execution time variation, and usage of physical buttons. The preliminary assessment showed that the fragility of UI tests can be a relevant issue also for mobile applications. A few common causes were found that can be used as the basis for providing guidelines for fragility avoidance and repair. },

@article{Coppola2019fv,
	abstract = {Evidence from empirical studies suggests that mobile applications are not thoroughly tested as their desktop counterparts. In particular, GUI testing is generally limited. Like web-based applications, mobile apps suffer from GUI testing fragility, i.e., GUI test classes failing or needing interventions because of modifications in the AUT or in its GUI arrangement and definition. The objective of our study is to examine the diffusion of test classes created with a set of popular GUI Automation Frameworks for Android apps, the amount of changes required to keep test classes up to date, and the amount of code churn in existing test suites, along with the underlying modifications in the AUT that caused such modifications. We defined 12 metrics to characterize the evolution of test classes and test methods, and a taxonomy of 28 possible causes for changes to test code. To perform our experiments, we selected six widely used open-source GUI Automation Frameworks for Android apps. We evaluated the diffusion of the tools by mining the GitHub repositories featuring them, and computed our set of metrics on the projects. Applying the Grounded Theory technique, we then manually analyzed diff files of test classes written with the selected tools, to build from the ground up a taxonomy of causes for modifications of test code. We found that none of the considered GUI automation frameworks achieved a major diffusion among open-source Android projects available on GitHub. For projects featuring tests created with the selected frameworks, we found that test suites had to be modified often --specifically, about 8{\%} of developers'modified LOCs belonged to test code and that a relevant portion (around 50{\%} on average) of those modifications were induced by modifications in GUI definition and arrangement. Test code written with GUI automation fromeworks proved to need significant interventions during the lifespan of a typical Android open-source project. This can be seen as an obstacle for developers to adopt this kind of test automation. The evaluations and measurements of the maintainance needed by test code wrtitten with GUI automation frameworks, and the taxonomy of modification causes, can serve as a benchmark for developers, and the basis for the formulation of actionable guidelines and the development of automated tools to help mitigating the issue.},

	abstract = {Software engineering discipline contains several prediction approaches such as test effort prediction, correction cost prediction, fault prediction, reusability prediction, security prediction, effort prediction, and quality prediction. However, most of these prediction approaches are still in preliminary phase and more research should be conducted to reach robust models. Software fault prediction is the most popular research area in these prediction approaches and recently several research centers started new projects on this area. In this study, we investigated 90 software fault prediction papers published between year 1990 and year 2009 and then we categorized these papers according to the publication year. This paper surveys the software engineering literature on software fault prediction and both machine learning based and statistical based approaches are included in this survey. Papers explained in this article reflect the outline of what was published so far, but naturally this is not a complete review of all the papers published so far. This paper will help researchers to investigate the previous studies from metrics, methods, datasets, performance evaluation metrics, and experimental results perspectives in an easy and effective manner. Furthermore, current trends are introduced and discussed.},

	abstract = { Mutation testing introduces artificial defects to measure the adequacy of testing. In case candidate tests can distinguish the behaviour of mutants from that of the original program, they are considered of good quality -- otherwise developers need to design new tests. While, this method has been shown to be effective, industry-scale code challenges its applicability due to the sheer number of mutants and test executions it requires. In this paper we present PIT, a practical mutation testing tool for Java, applicable on real-world codebases. PIT is fast since it operates on bytecode and optimises mutant executions. It is also robust and well integrated with development tools, as it can be invoked through a command line interface, Ant or Maven. PIT is also open source and hence, publicly available at url{http://pitest.org/} },

@article{Debroy2014nf,
	abstract = {This paper proposes a strategy for automatically fixing faults in a program by combining the ideas of mutation and fault localization. Statements ranked in order of their likelihood of containing faults are mutated in the same order to produce potential fixes for the faulty program. The proposed strategy is evaluated using 8 mutant operators against 19 programs each with multiple faulty versions. Our results indicate that 20.70% of the faults are fixed using selected mutant operators, suggesting that the strategy holds merit for automatically fixing faults. The impact of fault localization on efficiency of the overall fault-fixing process is investigated by experimenting with two different techniques, Tarantula and Ochiai, the latter of which has been reported to be better at fault localization than Tarantula, and also proves to be better in the context of fault-fixing using our proposed strategy. Further experiments are also presented to evaluate stopping criteria with respect to the mutant examination process and reveal that a significant fraction of the (fixable) faults can be fixed by examining a small percentage of the program code. We also report on the relative fault-fixing capabilities of mutant operators used and present discussions on future work.},

To perform this goal, we performed a bibliometric study, by applying the mapping study technique on top-quality software engineering venues, and developed a dataset of 14,456 primary studies. As the ranking metric for institutions, we used the count of papers in which authors affiliated with this institute have been identified in the obtained dataset, whereas regarding scholars we computed the corresponding rankings based on the number of published papers and the average number of citations. Finally, we identified the top-20 rising scholars in the SE research community, based on their recent publication record (between 2015 and 2017) and their research age.},

@article{Birch2019aa,
	abstract = {Fault localisation, i.e. the identification of program locations that cause errors, takes significant effort and cost. We describe a fast model-based fault localisation algorithm that, given a test suite, uses symbolic execution methods to fully automatically identify a small subset of program locations where genuine program repairs exist. Our algorithm iterates over failing test cases and collects locations where an assignment change can repair exhibited faulty behaviour. Our main contribution is an improved search through the test suite, reducing the effort for the symbolic execution of the models and leading to speed-ups of more than two orders of magnitude over the previously published implementation by Griesmayer et al. We implemented our algorithm for C programs, using the KLEE symbolic execution engine, and demonstrate its effectiveness on the Siemens TCAS variants. Its performance is in line with recent alternative model-based fault localisation techniques, but narrows the location set further without rejecting any genuine repair locations where faults can be fixed by changing a single assignment. We also show how our tool can be used in an educational context to improve self-guided learning and accelerate assessment. We apply our algorithm to a large selection of actual student coursework submissions, providing precise localisation within a sub-second response time. We show this using small test suites, already provided in the coursework management system, and on expanded test suites, demonstrating the scalability of our approach. We also show compliance with test suites does not reliably grade a class of ``almost-correct''submissions, which our tool highlights, as being close to the correct answer. Finally, we show an extension to our tool that extends our fast localisation results to a selection of student submissions that contain two faults.},

@article{Imtiaz2019aa,
	abstract = {Context
When an application evolves, some of the developed test cases break. Discarding broken test cases causes a significant waste of effort and leads to test suites that are less effective and have lower coverage. Test repair approaches evolve test suites along with applications by repairing the broken test cases.
Objective
Numerous studies are published on test repair approaches every year. It is important to summarise and consolidate the existing knowledge in the area to provide directions to researchers and practitioners. This research work provides a systematic literature review in the area of test case repair and breakage prevention, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in the field of software testing.
Method
We followed the standard protocol for conducting a systematic literature review. First, research goals were defined using the Goal Question Metric (GQM). Then we formulate research questions corresponding to each goal. Finally, metrics are extracted from the included papers. Based on the defined selection criteria a final set of 41 primary studies are included for analysis.
Results
The selection process resulted in 5 journal papers, and 36 conference papers. We present a taxonomy that lists the causes of test case breakages extracted from the literature. We found that only four proposed test repair tools are publicly available. Most studies evaluated their approaches on open-source case studies.
Conclusion
There is significant room for future research on test repair techniques. Despite the positive trend of evaluating approaches on large scale open source studies, there is a clear lack of results from studies done in a real industrial context. Few tools are publicly available which lowers the potential of adaption by industry practitioners.},

	abstract = {Mutation analysis is a popular technique for assessing the strength of test suites. It relies on the mutation score, which indicates their fault-revealing potential. Yet, there are mutants whose behaviour is equivalent to the original system, wasting analysis resources and preventing the satisfaction of a 100% mutation score. For finite behavioural models, the Equivalent Mutant Problem (EMP) can be transformed to the language equivalence problem of non-deterministic finite automata for which many solutions exist. However, these solutions are quite expensive, making computation unbearable when used for tackling the EMP. In this paper, we report on our assessment of a state-of-the-art exact language equivalence tool and two heuristics we proposed. We used 12 models, composed of (up to) 15,000 states, and 4710 mutants. We introduce a random and a mutation-biased simulation heuristics, used as baselines for comparison. Our results show that the exact approach is often more than ten times faster in the weak mutation scenario. For strong mutation, our biased simulations can be up to 1000 times faster for models larger than 300 states, while limiting the error of misclassifying non-equivalent mutants as equivalent to 8% on average. We therefore conclude that the approaches can be combined for improved efficiency.},

	abstract = {Crash reproduction approaches help developers during debugging by generating a test case that reproduces a given crash. Several solutions have been proposed to automate this task. However, the proposed solutions have been evaluated on a limited number of projects, making comparison difficult. In this paper, we enhance this line of research by proposing JCrashPack, an extensible benchmark for Java crash reproduction, together with ExRunner, a tool to simply and systematically run evaluations. JCrashPack contains 200 stack traces from various Java projects, including industrial open source ones, on which we run an extensive evaluation of EvoCrash, the state-of-the-art tool for search-based crash reproduction. EvoCrash successfully reproduced 43{\%} of the crashes. Furthermore, we observed that reproducing NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException, and IllegalStateException is relatively easier than reproducing ClassCastException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. Our results include a detailed manual analysis of EvoCrash outputs, from which we derive 14 current challenges for crash reproduction, among which the generation of input data and the handling of abstract and anonymous classes are the most frequents. Finally, based on those challenges, we discuss future research directions for search-based crash reproduction for Java.},

	abstract = {EvoCrash is a recent search-based approach to generate a test case that reproduces reported crashes. The search is guided by a fitness function that uses a weighted sum scalarization to combine three different heuristics: (i) code coverage, (ii) crash coverage and (iii) stack trace similarity. In this study, we propose and investigate two alternatives to the weighted sum scalarization: (i) the simple sum scalarization and (ii) the multi-objectivization, which decomposes the fitness function into several optimization objectives as an attempt to increase test case diversity. We implemented the three alternative optimizations as an extension of EvoSuite, a popular search-based unit test generator, and applied them on 33 real-world crashes. Our results indicate that for complex crashes the weighted sum reduces the test case generation time, compared to the simple sum, while for simpler crashes the effect is the opposite. Similarly, for complex crashes, multi-objectivization reduces test generation time compared to optimizing with the weighted sum; we also observe one crash that can be replicated only by multi-objectivization. Through our manual analysis, we found out that when optimizing the original weighted function gets trapped in local optima, optimization for decomposed objectives improves the search for crash reproduction. Generally, while multi-objectivization is under-explored, our results are promising and encourage further investigations of the approach.},

The combination of the well-known transition systems approach to formal behavioural modelling with feature expressions was pivotal to the design of efficient verification approaches. Such approaches indeed avoid to consider products' behaviour independently, leading to often exponential savings. Building on this successful structure, we lay the foundations of model-based testing approach to SPLs.

@article{Devroey2017,
	abstract = {Software product lines (SPLs) are families of software systems sharing common assets and exhibiting variabilities specific to each product member of the family. Commonalities and variabilities are often represented as features organized in a feature model. Due to combinatorial explosion of the number of products induced by possible features combinations, exhaustive testing of SPLs is intractable. Therefore, sampling and prioritization techniques have been proposed to generate sorted lists of products based on coverage criteria or weights assigned to features. Solely based on the feature model, these techniques do not take into account behavioural usage of such products as a source of prioritization. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of integrating usage models into the testing process to derive statistical testing approaches for SPLs. Usage models are given as Markov chains, enabling prioritization of probable/rare behaviours. We used featured transition systems, compactly modelling variability and behaviour for SPLs, to determine which products are realizing prioritized behaviours. Statistical prioritization can achieve a significant reduction in the state space, and modelling efforts can be rewarded by better automation. In particular, we used MaTeLo, a statistical test cases generation suite developed at ALL4TEC. We assess feasibility criteria on two systems: Claroline, a configurable course management system, and Sferion{\texttrademark}, an embedded system providing helicopter landing assistance.},

	abstract = {Mutation testing realizes the idea of using artificial defects to support testing activities. Mutation is typically used as a way to evaluate the adequacy of test suites, to guide the generation of test cases, and to support experimentation. Mutation has reached a maturity phase and gradually gains popularity both in academia and in industry. This chapter presents a survey of recent advances, over the past decade, related to the fundamental problems of mutation testing and sets out the challenges and open problems for the future development of the method. It also collects advices on best practices related to the use of mutation in empirical studies of software testing. Thus, giving the reader a ``mini-handbook''-style roadmap for the application of mutation testing as experimental methodology.},

	abstract = {Current state-of-the-art semantic role labeling (SRL) uses a deep neural network with no explicit linguistic features. However, prior work has shown that gold syntax trees can dramatically improve SRL decoding, suggesting the possibility of increased accuracy from explicit modeling of syntax. In this work, we present linguistically-informed self-attention (LISA): a neural network model that combines multi-head self-attention with multi-task learning across dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, predicate detection and SRL. Unlike previous models which require significant pre-processing to prepare linguistic features, LISA can incorporate syntax using merely raw tokens as input, encoding the sequence only once to simultaneously perform parsing, predicate detection and role labeling for all predicates. Syntax is incorporated by training one attention head to attend to syntactic parents for each token. Moreover, if a high-quality syntactic parse is already available, it can be beneficially injected at test time without re-training our SRL model. In experiments on CoNLL-2005 SRL, LISA achieves new state-of-the-art performance for a model using predicted predicates and standard word embeddings, attaining 2.5 F1 absolute higher than the previous state-of-the-art on newswire and more than 3.5 F1 on out-of-domain data, nearly 10{\%} reduction in error. On ConLL-2012 English SRL we also show an improvement of more than 2.5 F1. LISA also out-performs the state-of-the-art with contextually-encoded (ELMo) word representations, by nearly 1.0 F1 on news and more than 2.0 F1 on out-of-domain text.},

In this paper, we study the energy impact of alternative data management choices by programmers, such as data access patterns, data precision choices, and data organization. Second, we attempt to build a bridge between application-level energy management and hardware-level energy management, by elucidating how various application-level data management features respond to Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Finally, we apply our findings to real-world applications, demonstrating their potential for guiding application-level energy optimization. The empirical study is particularly relevant in the Big Data era, where data-intensive applications are large energy consumers, and their energy efficiency is strongly correlated to how data are maintained and handled in programs.},

@article{Lee2020vd,
	abstract = {Complex dependence analysis typically provides an underpinning approximation of true program dependence. We investigate the effectiveness of using lexical information to approximate such dependence, introducing two new deletion operators to Observation-Based Slicing (ORBS). ORBS provides direct observation of program dependence, computing a slice using iterative, speculative deletion of program parts. Deletions become permanent if they do not affect the slicing criterion. The original ORBS uses a bounded deletion window operator that attempts to delete consecutive lines together. Our new deletion operators attempt to delete multiple, non-contiguous lines that are lexically similar to each other. We evaluate the lexical dependence approximation by exploring the trade-off between the precision and the speed of dependence analysis performed with new deletion operators. The deletion operators are evaluated independently, as well as collectively via a novel generalization of ORBS that exploits multiple deletion operators: Multi-operator Observation-Based Slicing (MOBS). An empirical evaluation using three Java projects, six C projects, and one multi-lingual project written in Python and C finds that the lexical information provides a useful approximation to the underlying dependence. On average, MOBS can delete 69% of lines deleted by the original ORBS, while taking only 36% of the wall clock time required by ORBS.},

In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist  approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6% for IJB-A and 86.2% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

In particular, life and death decisions regarding the behavior of self-driving cars in trolley dilemma situations are attracting widespread interest in the recent debate. In this essay we want to ask whether we should implement a mandatory ethics setting (MES) for the whole of society or, whether every driver should have the choice to select his own personal ethics setting (PES). While the consensus view seems to be that people would not be willing to use an automated car that might sacrifice themselves in a dilemma situation, we will defend the somewhat contra-intuitive claim that this would be nevertheless in their best interest.

	abstract = {When building a unified vision system or gradually adding new capabilities to a system, the usual assumption is that training data for all tasks is always available. However, as the number of tasks grows, storing and retraining on such data becomes infeasible. A new problem arises where we add new capabilities to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but the training data for its existing capabilities are unavailable. We propose our Learning without Forgetting method, which uses only new task data to train the network while preserving the original capabilities. Our method performs favorably compared to commonly used feature extraction and fine-tuning adaption techniques and performs similarly to multitask learning that uses original task data we assume unavailable. A more surprising observation is that Learning without Forgetting may be able to replace fine-tuning as standard practice for improved new task performance.},

@article{Azeem2019aa,
	abstract = {Background: Code smells indicate suboptimal design or implementation choices in the source code that often lead it to be more change- and fault-prone. Researchers defined dozens of code smell detectors, which exploit different sources of information to support developers when diagnosing design flaws. Despite their good accuracy, previous work pointed out three important limitations that might preclude the use of code smell detectors in practice: (i) subjectiveness of developers with respect to code smells detected by such tools, (ii) scarce agreement between different detectors, and (iii) difficulties in finding good thresholds to be used for detection. To overcome these limitations, the use of machine learning techniques represents an ever increasing research area. Objective: While the research community carefully studied the methodologies applied by researchers when defining heuristic-based code smell detectors, there is still a noticeable lack of knowledge on how machine learning approaches have been adopted for code smell detection and whether there are points of improvement to allow a better detection of code smells. Our goal is to provide an overview and discuss the usage of machine learning approaches in the field of code smells. Method: This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on Machine Learning Techniques for Code Smell Detection. Our work considers papers published between 2000 and 2017. Starting from an initial set of 2456 papers, we found that 15 of them actually adopted machine learning approaches. We studied them under four different perspectives: (i) code smells considered, (ii) setup of machine learning approaches, (iii) design of the evaluation strategies, and (iv) a meta-analysis on the performance achieved by the models proposed so far. Results: The analyses performed show that God Class, Long Method, Functional Decomposition, and Spaghetti Code have been heavily considered in the literature. Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines are the most commonly used machine learning algorithms for code smell detection. Models based on a large set of independent variables have performed well. JRip and Random Forest are the most effective classifiers in terms of performance. The analyses also reveal the existence of several open issues and challenges that the research community should focus on in the future. Conclusion: Based on our findings, we argue that there is still room for the improvement of machine learning techniques in the context of code smell detection. The open issues emerged in this study can represent the input for researchers interested in developing more powerful techniques.},

Our GI-evolved solver achieves overall 17{\%} improvement, making it comparable with average expert human performance. Additionally, this automatically evolved solver is faster than any of the human-improved solvers for the CIT problem.},

This paper reviews the major deep learning concepts pertinent to medical image analysis and summarizes over 300 contributions to the field, most of which appeared in the last year. We survey the use of deep learning for image classification, object detection, segmentation, registration, and other tasks. Concise overviews are provided of studies per application area: neuro, retinal, pulmonary, digital pathology, breast, cardiac, abdominal, musculoskeletal. We end with a summary of the current state-of-the-art, a critical discussion of open challenges and directions for future research.},

	abstract = {We give a critical assessment of the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm in Python) open-source library and highly recommend it to both beginners and experts alike. DEAP supports a range of evolutionary algorithms including both strongly and loosely typed Genetic Programming, Genetic Algorithm, and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms such as NSGA-II and SPEA2. It contains most of the basic functions required by evolutionary computation, so that its users can easily construct various flavours of both single and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and execute them using multiple processors. It is ideal for fast prototyping and can be used with an abundance of other Python libraries for data processing as well as other machine learning techniques.},

Each of these two approaches has complementary strengths and weaknesses, making it a natural choice to explore the degree to which the strengths of one can be exploited to offset the weakness of the other. This paper introduces an augmented version of DSE that uses a SBST--based approach to handling floating point computations, which are known to be problematic for vanilla DSE. The approach has been implemented as a plug in for the Microsoft Pex DSE testing tool. The paper presents results from both, standard evaluation benchmarks, and two open source programs.},

@article{Binkley2019aa,
	abstract = {Observation-based slicing and its generalization observational slicing are recently-introduced, language-independent dynamic slicing techniques. They both construct slices based on the dependencies observed during program execution, rather than static or dynamic dependence analysis. The original implementation of the observation-based slicing algorithm used lines of source code as its program representation. A recent variation, developed to slice modelling languages (such as Simulink), used an XML representation of an executable model. We ported the XML slicer to source code by constructing a tree representation of traditional source code through the use of srcML. This work compares the tree- and line-based slicers using four experiments involving twenty different programs, ranging from classic benchmarks to million-line production systems. The resulting slices are essentially the same size for the majority of the programs and are often identical. However, structural constraints imposed by the tree representation sometimes force the slicer to retain enclosing control structures. It can also ``bog down'' trying to delete single-token subtrees. This occasionally makes the tree-based slices larger and the tree-based slicer slower than a parallelised version of the line-based slicer. In addition, a Java versus C comparison finds that the two languages lead to similar slices, but Java code takes noticeably longer to slice. The initial experiments suggest two improvements to the tree-based slicer: the addition of a size threshold, for ignoring small subtrees, and subtree replacement. The former enables the slicer to run 3.4 times faster while producing slices that are only about 9{\%} larger. At the same time the subtree replacement reduces size by about 8--12{\%} and allows the tree-based slicer to produce more natural slices.},

@article{Tonella2013aa,
	abstract = {Context
The order in which requirements are implemented affects the delivery of value to the end-user, but it also depends on technical constraints and resource availability. The outcome of requirements prioritization is a total ordering of requirements that best accommodates the various kinds of constraints and priorities. During requirements prioritization, some decisions on the relative importance of requirements or the feasibility of a given implementation order must necessarily resort to a human (e.g., the requirements analyst), possessing the involved knowledge.
Objective
In this paper, we propose an Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) that includes incremental knowledge acquisition and combines it with the existing constraints, such as dependencies and priorities. We also assess the performance of the proposed algorithm.
Method
The validation of IGA was conducted on a real case study, by comparing the proposed algorithm with the state of the art, interactive prioritization technique Incomplete Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP).
Results
The proposed method outperforms IAHP in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and robustness to decision maker errors.
Conclusion
IGA produces a good approximation of the reference requirements ranking, requiring an acceptable manual effort and tolerating a reasonable human error rate.},

	abstract = {Permutation-based encoding is used by many evolutionary algorithms dealing with combinatorial optimization problems. An important aspect of the evolutionary search process refers to the recombination process of existing individuals in order to generate new potentially better fit offspring leading to more promising areas of the search space. In this paper, we describe and analyze the best-order recombination operator for permutation-based encoding. The proposed operator uses genetic information from the two parents and from the best individual obtained up to the current generation. These sources of information are integrated to determine the best order of values in the new permutation. In order to evaluate the performance of best-order crossover, we address three well-known                                                                                                                                                                                                   {\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}NP{\}}{\$}                -hard optimization problems i.e. Travelling Salesman Problem, Vehicle Routing Problem and Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. For each of these problems, a set of benchmark instances is considered in a comparative analysis of the proposed operator with eight other crossover schemes designed for permutation representation. All crossover operators are integrated in the same standard evolutionary framework and using the same parameter setting to allow a comparison focused on the recombination process. Numerical results emphasize a good performance of the proposed crossover scheme which is able to lead to overall better quality solutions.},

	abstract = {A random-key genetic algorithm is an evolutionary metaheuristic for discrete and global optimization. Each solution is encoded as an array of n random keys, where a random key is a real number, randomly generated, in the continuous interval [0, 1). A decoder maps each array of random keys to a solution of the optimization problem being solved and computes its cost. The algorithm starts with a population of p arrays of random keys. At each iteration, the arrays are partitioned into two sets, a smaller set of high-valued elite solutions and the remaining nonelite solutions. All elite elements are copied, without change, to the next population. A small number of random-key arrays (the mutants) are added to the population of the next iteration. The remaining elements of the population of the next iteration are generated by combining, with the parametrized uniform crossover of Spears and DeJong (On the virtues of parameterized uniform crossover. In: Proceedings of the fourth international conference on genetic algorithms, San Mateo, pp 230--236, 1991), pairs of arrays. This chapter reviews random-key genetic algorithms and describes an effective variant called biased random-key genetic algorithms.},

The decomposition of the objective function of a problem into its elementary components provides additional knowledge on the problem that can be exploited to create new search methods for the problem. We analyze the Test Suite Minimization problem in Regression Testing from the point of view of landscape theory. We find the elementary landscape decomposition of the problem and propose a practical application of such decomposition for the search.},

@inproceedings{Huang2017kx,
	abstract = {Deep neural networks have achieved impressive experimental results in image classification, but can surprisingly be unstable with respect to adversarial perturbations, that is, minimal changes to the input image that cause the network to misclassify it. With potential applications including perception modules and end-to-end controllers for self-driving cars, this raises concerns about their safety. We develop a novel automated verification framework for feed-forward multi-layer neural networks based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). We focus on safety of image classification decisions with respect to image manipulations, such as scratches or changes to camera angle or lighting conditions that would result in the same class being assigned by a human, and define safety for an individual decision in terms of invariance of the classification within a small neighbourhood of the original image. We enable exhaustive search of the region by employing discretisation, and propagate the analysis layer by layer. Our method works directly with the network code and, in contrast to existing methods, can guarantee that adversarial examples, if they exist, are found for the given region and family of manipulations. If found, adversarial examples can be shown to human testers and/or used to fine-tune the network. We implement the techniques using Z3 and evaluate them on state-of-the-art networks, including regularised and deep learning networks. We also compare against existing techniques to search for adversarial examples and estimate network robustness.},

@article{Uy:2011aa,
	abstract = {We investigate the effects of semantically-based crossover operators in genetic programming, applied to real-valued symbolic regression problems. We propose two new relations derived from the semantic distance between subtrees, known as semantic equivalence and semantic similarity. These relations are used to guide variants of the crossover operator, resulting in two new crossover operators---semantics aware crossover (SAC) and semantic similarity-based crossover (SSC). SAC, was introduced and previously studied, is added here for the purpose of comparison and analysis. SSC extends SAC by more closely controlling the semantic distance between subtrees to which crossover may be applied. The new operators were tested on some real-valued symbolic regression problems and compared with standard crossover (SC), context aware crossover (CAC), Soft Brood Selection (SBS), and No Same Mate (NSM) selection. The experimental results show on the problems examined that, with computational effort measured by the number of function node evaluations, only SSC and SBS were significantly better than SC, and SSC was often better than SBS. Further experiments were also conducted to analyse the perfomance sensitivity to the parameter settings for SSC. This analysis leads to a conclusion that SSC is more constructive and has higher locality than SAC, NSM and SC; we believe these are the main reasons for the improved performance of SSC.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the use of genetic programming to perform automated discovery of numerical approximation formulae. We present results involving rediscovery of known approximations for Harmonic numbers, discovery of rational polynomial approximations for functions of one or more variables, and refinement of existing approximations through both approximation of their error function and incorporation of the approximation as a program tree in the initial GP population. Evolved rational polynomial approximations are compared to Pad{\'e} approximations obtained through the Maple symbolic mathematics package. We find that approximations evolved by GP can be superior to Pad{\'e} approximations given certain tradeoffs between approximation cost and accuracy, and that GP is able to evolve approximations in circumstances where the Pad{\'e} approximation technique cannot be applied. We conclude that genetic programming is a powerful and effective approach that complements but does not replace existing techniques from numerical analysis.},

@article{Uy:2011hc,
	abstract = {We investigate the effects of semantically-based crossover operators in genetic programming, applied to real-valued symbolic regression problems. We propose two new relations derived from the semantic distance between subtrees, known as semantic equivalence and semantic similarity. These relations are used to guide variants of the crossover operator, resulting in two new crossover operators---semantics aware crossover (SAC) and semantic similarity-based crossover (SSC). SAC, was introduced and previously studied, is added here for the purpose of comparison and analysis. SSC extends SAC by more closely controlling the semantic distance between subtrees to which crossover may be applied. The new operators were tested on some real-valued symbolic regression problems and compared with standard crossover (SC), context aware crossover (CAC), Soft Brood Selection (SBS), and No Same Mate (NSM) selection. The experimental results show on the problems examined that, with computational effort measured by the number of function node evaluations, only SSC and SBS were significantly better than SC, and SSC was often better than SBS. Further experiments were also conducted to analyse the perfomance sensitivity to the parameter settings for SSC. This analysis leads to a conclusion that SSC is more constructive and has higher locality than SAC, NSM and SC; we believe these are the main reasons for the improved performance of SSC.},

Jagadeesh et al. describe a solution that combines a protocol from modern cryptography with frequency-based clinical genetics used to diagnose causal disease mutations in patients with monogenic disorders. This framework correctly identified the causal gene in cases involving actual patients, while protecting more than 99\% of individual participants{\textquoteright} most private variants.Science, this issue p. 692Patient genomes are interpretable only in the context of other genomes; however, genome sharing enables discrimination. Thousands of monogenic diseases have yielded definitive genomic diagnoses and potential gene therapy targets. Here we show how to provide such diagnoses while preserving participant privacy through the use of secure multiparty computation. In multiple real scenarios (small patient cohorts, trio analysis, two-hospital collaboration), we used our methods to identify the causal variant and discover previously unrecognized disease genes and variants while keeping up to 99.7\% of all participants{\textquoteright} most sensitive genomic information private.},

Our approach aims to optimize both developers' team staffing and work package scheduling through cooperative co-evolution to achieve early overall completion time. To evaluate our approach, we conducted an empirical study, using data from four real-world software projects. Results indicate that the Co-evolutionary approach significantly outperforms a single population evolutionary algorithm. Cooperative co-evolution has not previously been applied to any problem in Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE), so this paper reports the first application of cooperative co-evolution in the SBSE literature. We believe that co-evolutionary optimization may fit many applications in other SBSE problem domains, since software systems often have complex inter-related subsystems and are typically characterized by problems that need to be co-evolved to improve results.},

@article{Arcuri:2013qv,
	abstract = {Many software engineering problems have been addressed with search algorithms. Search algorithms usually depend on several parameters (e.g., population size and crossover rate in genetic algorithms), and the choice of these parameters can have an impact on the performance of the algorithm. It has been formally proven in the No Free Lunch theorem that it is impossible to tune a search algorithm such that it will have optimal settings for all possible problems. So, how to properly set the parameters of a search algorithm for a given software engineering problem? In this paper, we carry out the largest empirical analysis so far on parameter tuning in search-based software engineering. More than one million experiments were carried out and statistically analyzed in the context of test data generation for object-oriented software using the EvoSuite tool. Results show that tuning does indeed have impact on the performance of a search algorithm. But, at least in the context of test data generation, it does not seem easy to find good settings that significantly outperform the ``default'' values suggested in the literature. This has very practical value for both researchers (e.g., when different techniques are compared) and practitioners. Using ``default'' values is a reasonable and justified choice, whereas parameter tuning is a long and expensive process that might or might not pay off in the end.},

	abstract = {We present a theory for slicing probabilistic imperative programs---containing random assignment and ``observe'' statements---represented as control flow graphs whose nodes transform probability distributions. We show that such a representation allows direct adaptation of standard machinery such as data and control dependence, postdominators, relevant variables, etc. to the probabilistic setting. We separate the specification of slicing from its implementation: first we develop syntactic conditions that a slice must satisfy; next we prove that any such slice is semantically correct; finally we give an algorithm to compute the least slice. A key feature of our syntactic conditions is that they involve two disjoint slices such that the variables of one slice are probabilistically independent of the variables of the other. This leads directly to a proof of correctness of probabilistic slicing.},

Analysis shows broad consensus that improvement is needed in problem selection and experimental rigor. While views expressed in the survey dissuade us from proposing a large-scale benchmark suite, we find community support for creating a ``blacklist'' of problems which are in common use but have important flaws, and whose use should therefore be discouraged. We propose a set of possible replacement problems.},

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.},

@article{Wong:2016aa,
	abstract = {Software fault localization, the act of identifying the locations of faults in a program, is widely recognized to be one of the most tedious, time consuming, and expensive -- yet equally critical -- activities in program debugging. Due to the increasing scale and complexity of software today, manually locating faults when failures occur is rapidly becoming infeasible, and consequently, there is a strong demand for techniques that can guide software developers to the locations of faults in a program with minimal human intervention. This demand in turn has fueled the proposal and development of a broad spectrum of fault localization techniques, each of which aims to streamline the fault localization process and make it more effective by attacking the problem in a unique way. In this article, we catalog and provide a comprehensive overview of such techniques and discuss key issues and concerns that are pertinent to software fault localization as a whole.},

@article{Bennett:1982ys,
	abstract = {Computers may be thought of as engines for transforming free energy into waste heat and mathematical work. Existing electronic computers dissipate energy vastly in excess of the mean thermal energykT, for purposes such as maintaining volatile storage devices in a bistable condition, synchronizing and standardizing signals, and maximizing switching speed. On the other hand, recent models due to Fredkin and Toffoli show that in principle a computer could compute at finite speed with zero energy dissipation and zero error. In these models, a simple assemblage of simple but idealized mechanical parts (e.g., hard spheres and flat plates) determines a ballistic trajectory isomorphic with the desired computation, a trajectory therefore not foreseen in detail by the builder of the computer. In a classical or semiclassical setting, ballistic models are unrealistic because they require the parts to be assembled with perfect precision and isolated from thermal noise, which would eventually randomize the trajectory and lead to errors. Possibly quantum effects could be exploited to prevent this undesired equipartition of the kinetic energy. Another family of models may be called Brownian computers, because they allow thermal noise to influence the trajectory so strongly that it becomes a random walk through the entire accessible (low-potential-energy) portion of the computer's configuration space. In these computers, a simple assemblage of simple parts determines a low-energy labyrinth isomorphic to the desired computation, through which the system executes its random walk, with a slight drift velocity due to a weak driving force in the direction of forward computation. In return for their greater realism, Brownian models are more dissipative than ballistic ones: the drift velocity is proportional to the driving force, and hence the energy dissipated approaches zero only in the limit of zero speed. In this regard Brownian models resemble the traditional apparatus of thermodynamic thought experiments, where reversibility is also typically only attainable in the limit of zero speed. The enzymatic apparatus of DNA replication, transcription, and translation appear to be nature's closest approach to a Brownian computer, dissipating 20--100kT per step. Both the ballistic and Brownian computers require a change in programming style: computations must be renderedlogically reversible, so that no machine state has more than one logical predecessor. In a ballistic computer, the merging of two trajectories clearly cannot be brought about by purely conservative forces; in a Brownian computer, any extensive amount of merging of computation paths would cause the Brownian computer to spend most of its time bogged down in extraneous predecessors of states on the intended path, unless an extra driving force ofkTln2 were applied (and dissipated) at each merge point. The mathematical means of rendering a computation logically reversible (e.g., creation and annihilation of a history file) will be discussed. The old Maxwell's demon problem is discussed in the light of the relation between logical and thermodynamic reversibility: the essential irreversible step, which prevents the demon from breaking the second law, is not the making of a measurement (which in principle can be done reversibly) but rather the logically irreversible act of erasing the record of one measurement to make room for the next. Converse to the rule that logically irreversible operations on data require an entropy increase elsewhere in the computer is the fact that a tape full of zeros, or one containing some computable pseudorandom sequence such as pi, has fuel value and can be made to do useful thermodynamic work as it randomizes itself. A tape containing an algorithmically random sequence lacks this ability.},

@article{Chicano:2011yg,
	abstract = {The Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) is an important problem that arises in the design of radio networks, when a channel has to be assigned to each transceiver of the network. This problem is a generalization of the graph coloring problem. In this paper we study a general version of the \{FAP\} that can include adjacent frequency constraints. Using concepts from landscapes' theory, we prove that this general \{FAP\} can be expressed as a sum of two elementary landscapes. Further analysis also shows that some subclasses of the problem correspond to a single elementary landscape. This allows us to compute the kind of neighborhood information that is normally associated with elementary landscapes. We also provide a closed form formula for computing the autocorrelation coefficient for the general FAP, which can be useful as an a priori indicator of the performance of a local search method. },

@article{Barnes:2003kq,
	abstract = {When joined to a stipulated neighborhood diagraph, an objective functin defined on the solution space of a real combinatorial optimization problem forms a landscape. Grover shows that landscapes satisfying a certain difference equation have properties favorable to local search. Studying only symmetric and regular neighborhood diagraphs, Stadler defines elementary landscapes as those which can be realized as an eigenvector of the Laplacian of the neighborhood diagraph, and shows that such landscapes satisfy Grover's difference equation. Recent developments in algebraic graph theory support a new definition of the graph Laplacian which we use to extend the notion of elementary landscapes to neighborhood diagraphs which may be neither regular nor symmetric. This paper uses the new definition to extend the notion of elementary landscapes so that they characterize landscapes satisfying Grover's wave equation. We extend some known results to these more general elementary landscapes and analyse the types which may occur. },

                 Programming that improves an existing program. We use
                 GI to evolve a faster version of a C++ program, a
                 Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver called MiniSAT,
                 specialising it for a particular problem class, namely
                 Combinatorial Interaction Testing (CIT), using
                 automated code transplantation. Our GI-evolved solver
                 achieves overall 17percent improvement, making it
                 comparable with average expert human performance.
                 Additionally, this automatically evolved solver is
                 faster than any of the human-improved solvers for the
                 CIT problem.},

@book{Poli:2008aa,
	abstract = {Genetic programming (GP) is a systematic,
                domain-independent method for getting computers to
                solve problems automatically starting from a high-level
                statement of what needs to be done. Using ideas from
                natural evolution, GP starts from an ooze of random
                computer programs, and progressively refines them
                through processes of mutation and sexual recombination,
                until high-fitness solutions emerge. All this without
                the user having to know or specify the form or
                structure of solutions in advance. GP has generated a
                plethora of human-competitive results and applications,
                including novel scientific discoveries and patentable
                inventions.

                This unique overview of this exciting technique is
                written by three of the most active scientists in GP.
                See www.gp-field-guide.org.uk for more information on
                the book.},

@article{Nourani:1998kq,
	abstract = {Using computer experiments on a simple three-state system and an NP-complete system of permanents we compare different proposed simulated annealing schedules in order to find the cooling strategy which has the least total entropy production during the annealing process for given initial and final states and fixed number of iterations. The schedules considered are constant thermodynamic speed, exponential, logarithmic, and linear cooling schedules. The constant thermodynamic speed schedule is shown to be the best. We are actually considering two different schedules with constant thermodynamic speed, the original one valid for near-equilibrium processes, and a version based on the natural timescale valid also at higher speeds. The latter one delivers better results, especially in case of fast cooling or when the system is far from equilibrium. Also with the lowest energy encountered during the entire optimization (the best-so-far-energy) as the indicator of merit, constant thermodynamic speed is superior. Finally, we have compared two different estimators of the relaxation time. One estimator is using the second largest eigenvalue of the thermalized form of the transition probability matrix and the other is using a simpler approximation for small deviations from equilibrium. These two different expressions only agree at high temperatures.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have established the link between one's actions (e.g., engaging with others vs. minding one's own business) and one's national culture (e.g., collectivist vs. individualistic), and such actions have been shown to be important as they are collectively affiliated with a country's economic outcomes (e.g., Gross Domestic Product).  Hitherto there has not been any systematic study of whether one's action on Twitter (e.g., deciding when to post messages) is linked to one's culture (e.g., country's Pace of Life). To fix that, we build different network snapshots starting from 55,000 seed users on Twitter, and we do so for 10 weeks across 30 countries (after filtering those with low penetration rates) for a total of 2.34 M profiles. Based on Hofstede's theory of cultural dimensions and Levine's Pace of Life theory, we consider three behavioral patterns on Twitter (i.e., temporal predictability of tweets, engaging with others, and supporting others who are less popular) and associate them with three different dimensions derived from the two theories: Pace of Life, Individualism and Power Distance. We find the following strong correlations: activity predictability  negatively correlates with Pace of Life (r=-0.62), tweets with mentions negatively correlates with Individualism (r = -0.55), and power (e.g, Twitter popularity) imbalance in relationships (between, for example, two users mentioning each other) is correlated with Power Distance (r=0.62). These three cultural dimensions matter because they are associated with a country's socio-economic aspects - with GDP per capita, income inequality, and education expenditure.},

@inproceedings{Afshan:2013vn,
	abstract = {The frequent non-availability of an automated oracle means that, in practice, 
               checking software behaviour is frequently a painstakingly manual task. Despite 
               the high cost of human oracle involvement, there has been little research 
               investigating how to make the role easier and less time- consuming. One source 
               of human oracle cost is the inherent unreadability of machine-generated test 
               inputs. In particular, automatically generated string inputs tend to be arbitrary 
               sequences of characters that are awkward to read. This makes test cases hard to
               comprehend and time-consuming to check. In this paper we present an approach in 
               which a natural language model is incorporated into a search-based input data 
               generation process with the aim of improving the human readability of generated 
               strings. We further present a human study of test inputs generated using the 
               technique on 17 open source Java case studies. For 10 of the case studies, the 
               participants recorded significantly faster times when evaluating inputs produced 
               using the language model, with medium to large effect sizes 60% of the time. In 
               addition, the study found that accuracy of test input evaluation was also 
               significantly improved for 3 of the case studies.},

@article{Basanta:2008fk,
	abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>During development, multicellular animals are shaped by cell proliferation, cell rearrangement, and cell death to generate an adult whose form is maintained over time. Disruption of this finely balanced state can have devastating consequences, including aging, psoriasis, and cancer. Typically, however, development is robust, so that animals achieve the same final form even when challenged by environmental damage such as wounding. To see how morphogenetic robustness arises, we have taken an in silico approach to evolve digital organisms that exhibit distinct phases of growth and homeostasis. During the homeostasis period, organisms were found to use a variety of strategies to maintain their form. Remarkably, however, all recovered from severe wounds, despite having evolved in the absence of selection pressure to do so. This ability to regenerate was most striking in an organism with a tissue-like architecture, where it was enhanced by a directional flux of cells that drives tissue turnover. This identifies a stratified architecture, like that seen in human skin and gut, as an evolutionarily accessible and robust form of tissue organisation, and suggests that wound-healing may be a general feature of evolved morphogenetic systems. Both may therefore contribute to homeostasis, wound-healing, and regeneration in real animals.</p>},

	abstract = {We propose an approach to quantify interference in a simple imperative language that includes a looping construct. In this paper we focus on a particular case of this definition of interference: leakage of information from private variables to public ones via a Trojan Horse attack. We quantify leakage in terms of Shannon's information theory and we motivate our definition by proving a result relating this definition of leakage and the classical notion of programming language interference. The major contribution of the paper is a quantitative static analysis based on this definition for such a language. The analysis uses some non-trivial information theory results like Fano's inequality and the ℒ1 inequality to provide reasonable bounds for conditional statements. While-loops are handled by integrating a qualitative flow-sensitive dependency analysis into the quantitative analysis.},

	abstract = {McGraw and Wong (1992) described an appealing index of effect size, called "CL", which measures the difference between two populations in terms of the probability that a score sampled at random from the first population will be greater than a score sampled at random from the second. McGraw and Wong introduced this "common language effect size statistic" for normal distributions and then proposed an approximate estimation for any continuous distribution. In addition, they generalized "CL" to the n-group case, the correlated samples case, and the discrete values case. In the current paper a different generalization of "CL" called the A measure of stochastic superiority, is proposed, which may be directly applied for any discrete or continuous variable that is at least ordinally scaled. Exact methods for point and interval estimation as well as the significance tests of the A = .5 hypothesis are provided. New generalizations of "CL" are provided for the multi-group and correlated samples cases.},

@article{Kanstren2009,
	abstract = {Software testing requires a test oracle that makes an assessment of the correctness of the tested program behaviour, based on a priori created model. While test automation is a popular research topic, there is only a limited amount of work in the subject of automating the process of creating test oracles. This lack of test oracle automation greatly limits the usefulness of automated testing techniques. One reason for this is the difficulty to automatically determine the correctness of previously unknown software. Instead the task of coming up with a useful oracle is often left to the user as a manual task. Program comprehension techniques are focused on supporting the building of human understanding for a previously unknown program, and as such are good candidates to assist in the test oracle creation process. This paper addresses the lack of automated support for test oracle creation by providing a framework for using program comprehension techniques to provide automated assistance to the user in creating test oracles. Based on analysis of existing work and theoretical background, the basic concept for this process is defined. A case example demonstrates the practical application of this concept with the generation of a model, including a test oracle, for model-based testing. From the existing approaches and the presented case example, a framework for this type of process is presented in order to provide a basis for providing more powerful techniques for user-assisted test oracle generation. 2009 IEEE.},

We describe an algorithm that can be used to generate a test oracle from program documentation, and present the results of using a tool based on it to help test part of a commercial network management application. The results demonstrate that these methods can be effective at detecting errors and greatly increase the speed and accuracy of test evaluation when compared with manual evaluation. Such oracles can be used for unit testing, in situ testing, constructing self-checking software, and ensuring consistency between code and documentation.},

@article{Baek:2011fk,
	abstract = {Why does Zipf's law give a good description of data from seemingly completely unrelated phenomena? Here it is argued that the reason is that they can all be described as outcomes of a ubiquitous random group division: the elements can be citizens of a country and the groups family names, or the elements can be all the words making up a novel and the groups the unique words, or the elements could be inhabitants and the groups the cities in a country and so on. A random group formation (RGF) is presented from which a Bayesian estimate is obtained based on minimal information: it provides the best prediction for the number of groups with k elements, given the total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. For each specification of these three values, the RGF predicts a unique group distribution N(k) proportional to exp(-bk)/k(gamma), where the power-law index gamma is a unique function of the same three values. The universality of the result is made possible by the fact that no system-specific assumptions are made about the mechanism responsible for the group division. The direct relation between gamma and the total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group is calculated. The predictive power of the RGF model is demonstrated by direct comparison with data from a variety of systems. It is shown that gamma usually takes values in the interval 1 <= gamma <= 2 and that the value for a given phenomenon depends in a systematic way on the total size of the dataset. The results are put in the context of earlier discussions on Zipf's and Gibrat's laws, N(k) proportional to k(-2) and the connection between growth models and RGF is elucidated.},

	are presented to validate the approach using two real-world data

	abstract = {There is a growing recognition that an incremental approach to software
	development is often more suitable and less risky than the traditional
	waterfall approach. Delivering software in an incremental fashion
	suggests better customer satisfaction and reduces many of the risks
	associated with delivering large software projects. In this paper,
	we consider the problem of deciding which requirements should be
	assigned to which release. The proposed hybrid approach called EVOLVE*
	improves existing methods for release planning by combining the strength
	of mathematical models with the subtleness of experts' knowledge
	and judgment. It makes use of different computationally intelligent
	techniques such as evolutionary computing and principles of multi-criteria
	decision aid. This is combined with appropriate involvement of human
	intelligence. EVOLVE* consists of three main phases called modeling,
	exploration, and consolidation. Different from former algorithms
	of the EVOLVE family, our new approach plans only two releases in
	advance, i.e., each requirement is assigned to one of the following
	three categories: "next release", "next but one release", "not yet
	assigned". EVOLVE* aims to achieve maximum stakeholder satisfaction.
	Our iterative procedure allows intelligent search of most promising
	solutions under the competing criteria of time, benefit and quality
	as described by the "magic triangle". The complete approach is illustrated
	by a case study example.},

	A novel approach to requirements optimization is described. A requirements

	This produces a large amount of data, which is then condensed by
	a summarization tool. The result is a small list of critical decisions

	This focuses human experts' attention on a relatively few decisions
	and makes them aware of major alternatives.
	
	
	This approach is iterative. Each iteration allows experts to select
	from among the major alternatives. In successive iterations the execution
	and summarization modules are run again, but each time further constrained
	by the decisions made in previous iteration. In the case study shown

	abstract = {Recent work with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has allowed for
	external access to five of JPL's real-world requirements models,
	anonymized to conceal proprietary information, but retaining their
	computational nature. Experimentation with these models, reported
	herein, demonstrates a dramatic speedup in the computations performed
	on them.
	
	
	These models have a well defined goal: select mitigations that retire
	risks which, in turn, increases the number of attainable requirements.
	Such a non-linear optimization is a well-studied problem. However
	identification of not only (a) the optimal solution(s) but also (b)
	the key factors leading to them is less well studied.Our technique,
	called KEYS, shows a rapid way of simultaneously identifying the
	solutions and their key factors.
	
	
	KEYS improves on prior work by several orders of magnitude. Prior
	experiments with simulated annealing or treatment learning took tens
	of minutes to hours to terminate. KEYS runs much faster than that;
	e.g for one model, KEYS ran 13,000 times faster than treatment learning
	(40 minutes versus 0.18 seconds).
	
	
	Processing these JPL models is a non-linear optimization problem:
	the fewest mitigations must be selected while achieving the most
	requirements. Non-linear optimization is a well studied problem.
	With this paper, we challenge other members of the PROMISE community

@article{KapurNRS08,
	abstract = {Release planning for incremental software development assigns features
	to releases such that technical, resource, risk and budget constraints
	are met. Each feature offers a piece of functionality. A feature
	can be offered as part of a release only if all its necessary tasks
	are done before the given release date. These tasks require different
	skills. Staffing for product releases as considered in this paper
	is the process of assigning human resources from a given pool of
	developers who might have varying levels of skill to perform different
	tasks. In addition to that, we consider time windows of absence of
	the developers. The primary goal of staffing is to provide product
	releases of best quality where quality means offering the most attractive
	features to customers in a timely manner. We call the problem STAFF-PRO.
	The problem is known to be NP-complete. Consequently, we have to
	be satisfied with solutions that are sufficiently good, but not necessarily
	optimal in the case of mid-sized or large problems. Search-based
	methods relying on meta-heuristics have been proven to be successful
	in similar contexts. In this research, a focused search (FS) method
	is presented. This refers to a two-phased solution approach where
	Phase 1 applies integer linear programming to a relaxed version of
	the full problem. Its solution is used as a starting point to perform
	FS in a reduced search space in Phase 2. The search itself is conducted
	by a genetic algorithm. It generates a solution that fulfills all
	the stated resource and scheduling constraints and is of a proven
	degree of optimality. We performed an empirical analysis of the proposed
	solution approach by comparing FS and unfocused search (UFS) (without
	Phase 1) for a series of 200 test examples. On average, FS performs
	about 15% better than UFS. The whole method was applied as an industrial
	case study performed at Chartwell Technology. The case study demonstrates
	that application of the FS method to STAFF-PRO (i) allows a reduction
	in the time needed for generating acceptable staffing plans, (ii)
	generates plans of proven quality that are better than manual plans
	and (iii) supports the various types of re-planning necessary for
	varying parameters, budgets and resource.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates two integer linear programming models that
	integrate requirement scheduling into software release planning.
	The first model can schedule the development of the requirements
	for the new release exactly in time so that the project span is minimized
	and the resource and precedence constraints are satisfied. The second
	model is for combined requirement selection and scheduling, which
	can not only maximize revenues but also calculates an on-time-delivery
	project schedule simultaneously. Two simulations are presented to
	examine the influence of precedence constraints and compare the differences
	of the traditional prioritization models and the two new ones. The
	simulation results suggest that requirement dependency can significantly
	influence the project plan and the combined model for requirement
	selection and scheduling is better in the sense of efficiency and
	on-time delivery.},

	abstract = {For software vendors, the process to determine the requirements for
	the next release of a software product is often difficult. In this
	paper we present a mathematical formalization of release composition
	with a corresponding optimization tool that aims to support product
	managers and development project managers during release planning.
	The tool is based on integer linear programming and assumes that
	an optimal set of requirements is the set with maximum projected
	revenue against available resources in a given time period. The input
	for the optimization is twofold. Input data like the list of candidate
	requirements, estimated revenue and required team resources per requirement,
	whether or not a requirement is mandatory, comprise the first type
	of input. Secondly, several managerial steering mechanisms provide
	flexibility in the optimization environment: team composition, permitting
	of team transfers, extension of deadlines, and hiring external resources.
	Through experiments based on real-life data we make a sound case
	for the applicability of our proposal.},

	abstract = {Delivering software in an incremental fashionimplicitly reduces many
	of the risks associatedwith delivering large software projects. However,adopting
	a process, where requirements aredelivered in releases means decisions
	have to bemade on which requirements should be deliveredin which
	release. This paper describes a methodcalled EVOLVE+, based on a
	genetic algorithmand aimed at the evolutionary planning ofincremental
	software development. The method isinitially evaluated using a sample
	project. Theevaluation involves an investigation of the trade-offrelationship
	between risk and the overallbenefit. The link to empirical research
	is two-fold:Firstly, our model is based on interaction withindustry
	and randomly generated data for effortand risk of requirements. The
	results achieved thisway are the first step for a more comprehensiveevaluation
	using real-world data. Secondly, we tryto approach uncertainty of
	data by additionalcomputational effort providing more insight intothe
	problem solutions: (i) Effort estimates areconsidered to be stochastic
	variables following agiven probability function; (ii) Instead of
	offeringjust one solution, the L-best (L>1) solutions aredetermined.
	This provides support in finding themost appropriate solution, reflecting
	implicitpreferences and constraints of the actual decision-maker.Stability

	abstract = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are effective and robust methods for solving many practical problems such as feature selection, electrical circuits synthesis, and data mining. However, they may execute for a long time for some difficult problems, because several fitness evaluations must be performed. A promising approach to overcome this limitation is to parallelize these algorithms. In this chapter, we propose to implement a parallel EA on consumer-level Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We perform experiments to compare our parallel EA with an ordinary EA and demonstrate that the former is much more effective than the latter. Since consumer-level graphics processing units are already widely available and installed on oridinary personal computers and they are easy to use and manage, more people will be able to use our parallel algorithm to solve their problems encountered in real-world applications. },

@article{Weinberger:1990uq,
	abstract = {The properties of multi-peaked ``fitness landscapes''have attracted attention in a wide variety of fields, including evolutionary biology. However, relaively little attention has been paid to the properties of the landscapes themselves. Herein, we suggest a framework for the mathematical treatment of such landscapes, including an explicit mathematical model. A central role in this discussion is played by the autocorrelation of fitnesses obtained from a random walk on the landscape. Our ideas about average autocorrelations allow us to formulate a condition (satisfied by a wide class of landscapes we call AR(1) landscapes) under which the average autocorrelation approximates a decaying exponential. We then show how our mathematical model can be used to estimate both the globally optimal fitnesses of AR(1) landscapes and their local structure. We illustrate some aspects of our method with computer experiments based on a single family of landscapes (Kauffman's ``N-k model''), that is shown to be a generic AR(1) landscape. We close by discussing how these ideas might be useful in the ``tuning''of combinatorial optimization algorithms, and in modelling in the experimental sciences.},

	abstract = {The importance of tuning a search algorithm for the specific features of the target search space has been known for quite some time. However, when dealing with multiobjective problems, there are several twists on the conventional notions of fitness landscapes. Multiobjective optimization problems provide additional difficulties for those seeking to study the properties of the search space. However, the requirement of finding multiple candidate solutions to the problem also introduces new potentially exploitable structure. This paper provides a somewhat high-level overview of multiobjective search space and fitness landscape analysis and examines the impact of these features on the multiobjective generalized assignment problem. },

	abstract = {This paper reports an empirical evaluation of four black-box testing techniques for crashing programs through their GUI interface: SH, AF, DH, and BxT. The techniques vary in their level of automation and the results they offer. The experiments we conducted quantify execution time and the capability of finding a crash for each technique on 8 different cellular phone configurations with historical (real) errors. The results show that AF and BxT offered better precision (i.e., the fraction of runs that end in a crash out of the total number of runs) than SH and DH (AF and BxT found crashes in all 8 configurations), and BxT crashes the application the fastest more often (5 out of 8 cases). The experiments reveal that the selection of the random seed to AF and BxT results in a high variance of execution time (i.e., the time the technique takes to either crash the application or timeout in 40 h): the mean (across 8 phone configurations) of the standard deviation of execution times (for 10 runs per each phone configuration) is 7.79 h for AF and 5.21 h for BxT. Despite this fact, AF and BxT could crash the application consistently: the mean of the precision (fraction of the 10 runs that results in a crash) is 74\% for AF and 69\% for BxT.},

@article{Martins:2005ud,
	abstract = {A reusable class must be tested many times: each time modifications are applied to it or its base classes; when a subclass is created, in which case the inherited and redefined features must be retested in the new context. Therefore, a class should be easy to test, specifically for test execution and results analysis, since these activities must be repeated often. Inspired by R. Binder's self-testing class concept {$[$}4{$]$} we defined, in a previous work, a testable class as a 3-tuple: class implementation, class behavior model and built-in test (BIT) mechanisms. In this work we present how to use this information when a class is changed. Regression testing is necessary each time a software is changed, to assure that the modifications do not adversely affect the unchanged parts. It is assumed that the test suite applied when testing the old version is available for reuse. However, test suites can be large and require too much effort to be reapplied in their totality. In such cases, a subset of the tests must be selected. This selection usually requires extra information besides the source code. This work aims at answering the following question: how to use test information contained in a testable class to do regression testing? The answer involves, among other aspects, the definition of an approach to select tests for reuse. The approach can be fully automated and does not need the source code for regression-test selection.},

@inproceedings{Qu:2007eu,
	abstract = {Regression testing is an expensive part of the software maintenance process. Effective regression testing techniques select and order (or prioritize) test cases between successive releases of a program. However, selection and prioritization are dependent on the quality of the initial test suite. An effective and cost efficient test generation technique is combinatorial interaction testing, CIT, which systematically samples all t-way combinations of input parameters. Research on CIT, to date, has focused on single version software systems. There has been little work that empirically assesses the use of CIT test generation as the basis for selection or prioritization. In this paper we examine the effectiveness of CIT across multiple versions of two software subjects. Our results show that CIT performs well in finding seeded faults when compared with an exhaustive test set. We examine several CIT prioritization techniques and compare them with a re-generation/prioritization technique. We find that prioritized and re-generated/prioritized CIT test suites may find faults earlier than unordered CIT test suites, although the re-generated/prioritized test suites sometimes exhibit decreased fault detection.},

	abstract = {Service-oriented Architectures (SOA) introduce a major shift of perspective in software engineering: in contrast to components, services are used instead of being physically integrated. This leaves the user with no control over changes that can happen in the service itself. When the service evolves, the user may not be aware of the changes, and this can entail unexpected system failures. When a system integrator discovers a service and starts to use it, she/he may need to periodically re-test it to build confidence that (i) the service delivers over the time the desired functionality and (ii) at the same time it is able to meet Quality of Service requirements. Test cases can be used as a form of contract between a provider and the system integrators. This chapter describes an approach and a tool to allow users to run a test suite against a service to discover if functional and non-functional expectations are maintained over time.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) for automatic software test data generation. This
    research extends previous work on dynamic test data generation where the problem of test data generation is
    reduced to one of minimizing a function. In our work, the function is minimized by using one of two genetic
    algorithms in place of the local minimization techniques used in earlier research. We describe the implementation
    of our GA-based system and examine the effectiveness of this approach on a number of programs, one of
    which is significantly larger than those for which results have previously been reported in the literature. We
    also examine the effect of program complexity on the test data generation problem by executing our system
    on a number of synthetic programs that have varying complexities.},

@article{burgess:ist,
	abstract = {Accurate software effort estimation is an important
                 part of the software process. Originally, estimation
                 was performed using only human expertise, but more
                 recently attention has turned to a variety of machine
                 learning methods. This paper attempts to evaluate
                 critically the potential of genetic programming (GP) in
                 software effort estimation when compared with
                 previously published approaches, in terms of accuracy
                 and ease of use. The comparison is based on the
                 well-known Desharnais data set of 81 software projects
                 derived from a Canadian software house in the late
                 1980s. The input variables are restricted to those
                 available from the specification stage and significant
                 effort is put into the GP and all of the other solution
                 strategies to offer a realistic and fair comparison.
                 There is evidence that GP can offer significant
                 improvements in accuracy but this depends on the
                 measure and interpretation of accuracy used. GP has the
                 potential to be a valid additional tool for software
                 effort estimation but set up and running effort is high
                 and interpretation difficult, as it is for any complex
                 meta-heuristic technique.},

	abstract = {This paper presents initial results of a study on the application of evolutionary multi-objective optimization methods in the design of the steel structural systems of tall buildings.  In the paper, a brief overview of the state-of-the-art in evolutionary multi-objective optimization in structural engineering is provided.   Next, conceptual design of steel structural systems in tall buildings is overviewed and the representations of steel structural systems used in the paper are discussed.  Furthermore, Emergent Designer, a unique evolutionary design tool developed at George Mason University, is briefly described.  It is an integrated research and design support tool which applies models of complex adaptive systems to represent engineering systems and to analyze design processes and their results.  The paper also presents the results of several multi-objective structural design experiments conducted with Emergent Designer in which steel structural systems in tall buildings were optimized with respect to their total weight and maximum deflection (two-objective minimization problem).  The goal of these experiments was to determine feasibility of evolutionary multi-objective optimization of steel structural systems of tall buildings as well as to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the results with the previous findings obtained with single-objective evolutionary optimization methods.  Finally, initial research conclusions are presented as well as promising research directions.},

Fitness is taken as the product of the objective with an ``attenuation'' factor which is 1 for feasible solutions but some variable fraction of 1 for infeasible ones. It is shown that this technique leads to algorithms which converge in probability to globally optimal feasible solutions. An application of the technique is made to a problem of engineering interest with excellent results: the ground water treatment problem for unconfined aquifers},

	abstract = {The maintenance of a software system requires a tool
                 for impact analysis and the propagation of change. This
                 paper presents a knowledge-based model for both. This
                 model is generic because it is not based on any
                 language or design method. Therefore, it can be applied
                 on the basis of a `problem' to be solved. It also
                 captures four life-cycle phases: requirement,
                 specification, design and programming. We also provide
                 a domain-specific view that allows the dependency
                 analysis of fine-grain objects. Two kinds of
                 dependencies are identified: inter-phase dependencies,
                 these are dependency relations between the objects of
                 one phase and another; and intra-phase dependencies,
                 these are dependency relations between the objects of
                 the same phase. In order to validate this model, we
                 also present a prototype based on two life-cycle
                 phases: design and programming.},

                 The specializer specializes functions with respect to
                 each static value. Since, at compile time, they
                 guarantee finite domains of static values, they simply
                 specialize with respect to each value. There are
                 problems with recursion, however, and there is no
                 guarantee of termination. In addition, array splitting
                 is not done if a pointer is used to walk the array.},

                 language, called Alma-O, that augments the expressive
                 power of imperative programming by a limited number of
                 features inspired by the logic programming paradigm.
                 These additions encourage declarative programming and
                 make it a more attractive vehicle for problems that
                 involve search. We illustrate the use of Alma-O by
                 presenting solutions to a number of classical problems,
                 including [alpha]-[beta] search, STRIPS planning,
                 knapsack, and Eight Queens. These solutions are
                 substantially simpler than their counterparts written
                 in the imperative or in the logic programming style and
                 can be used for different purposes without any
                 modification. We also discuss here the implementation
                 of Alma-O and an operational, executable, semantics of
                 a large subset of the language.},

	abstract = {Computer architecture manuals describe the instruction
                 set of the machine and the semantics of those
                 instructions by a combination of natural language and
                 ISP (Instruction Set Processor) descriptions. The
                 syntax of the instructions in assembly is well define
                 in the form of tables in the manual. However, the
                 semantics is not so well specified and descriptions
                 vary widely from one manual to another. When developing
                 a retargetable binary translator, as much as possible
                 needs to be specified in order to automatically
                 generate code from specifications, hence separating
                 machine-independent issues from the manual coding
                 stage. The specification of the semantics of machine
                 instructions is one such task, with the aim of
                 generating suitable code for an intermediate
                 representation that is to be used during the analysis
                 stage. We describe the design process used to develop a
                 semantic specification language, SSL, to integrate into
                 a retargetable binary translation framework. The
                 techniques described herein are suitable not just to
                 binary translators but also to machine-code
                 manipulation tools such as optimizing compilers, binary
                 profilers, instrumentors, and binary debuggers.},

                 process is to analyze the structural characteristics of
                 the existing software so as to produce software
                 component sets, each of which is a candidate for
                 clustering and reengineering into a reusable module.
                 This step is founded on one ore more Candidature
                 Criteria and the cost of the following steps depend on
                 their quality. This paper introduces the notions of
                 completeness and adequacy as applied to candidature
                 criteria and outlines the need for an adquacy
                 validation process before they are applied on a
                 software system. An adequacy validation process founded
                 on the assignment of a concept to the candidate modules
                 is proposed and the results coming from an application
                 of this process are described and discussed.},

                 test data to detect specific types of common
                 programming faults. The conditions under which faults
                 will be detected are encoded as mathematical systems of
                 constraints in terms of program symbols. A set of
                 tools, collectively called Godzilla, has been
                 implemented that automatically generates constraint
                 systems and solves them to create test cases for use by
                 the Mothra testing system. Experimental results from
                 using Godzilla show that the technique can produce test
                 data that is very close in terms of mutation adequacy
                 to test data that is produced manually, and at
                 substantially reduced costs. Additionally, these
                 experiments have suggested a new procedure for unit
                 testing, where test cases are viewed as throw-away

	abstract = {A programmer spends more time modifying already
                 existing programs than constructing original ones. An
                 attempt is made to formulate techniques of program
                 modification, whereby a program that achieves one
                 result can be transformed into a new program that uses
                 the same principles to achieve a different goal. For
                 example, a program that uses the binary search paradigm
                 to divide two numbers may be modified to calculate the
                 square-root of a number in a similar manner. Program
                 debugging is considered as a special case of
                 modification; if a program computes wrong results, it
                 must be modified to achieve the intended results. The
                 application of abstract program schemata to concrete
                 problems is also viewed from the perspective of
                 modification techniques. We have embedded this approach
                 in a running implementation; our methods are
                 illustrated with several examples that have been
                 performed by it.},

                 identification of objects in legacy code take the data
                 structures as starting point for candidate classes.
                 Unfortunately, legacy data structures tend to grow over
                 time, and may contain many unrelated fields at the time
                 of migration. We propose a method for identifying
                 objects by semi-automatically restructuring the legacy
                 data structures. Issues involved include the selection
                 of record fields of interest, the identification of
                 procedures actually dealing with such fields, and the
                 construction of coherent groups of fields and
                 procedures into candidate classes. We explore the use
                 of cluster and concept analysis for the purpose of
                 object identification, and we illustrate their effect
                 on a 100,000 LOC COBOL system. Furthermore, we use
                 these results to contrast clustering with concept
                 analysis techniques.},

	abstract = {The question of finding a function for software cost
                 estimation is a long-standing issue in the software
                 engineering field. The results of other works have
                 shown different patterns for the unknown function,
                 which relates software size to project cost (effort).
                 In this work, the research about this problem has been
                 made by using the technique of Genetic Programming (GP)
                 for exploring the possible cost functions. Both
                 standard regression analysis and GP have been applied
                 and compared on several data sets. However, regardless
                 of the method, the basic size-effort relationship does
                 not show satisfactory results, from the predictive
                 point of view, across all data sets. One of the results
                 of this work is that we have not found significant
                 deviations from the linear model in the software cost
                 functions. This result comes from the marginal cost
                 analysis of the equations with best predictive
                 values.},

                 interprocedural data flow analysis have led to an
                 increased interest in demand-driven algorithms. In this
                 article, we present a general framework for developing
                 demand-driven interprocedural data flow analyzers and
                 report our experience in evaluating the performance of
                 this approach. A demand for data flow information is
                 modeled as a set of queries. The framework includes a
                 generic demand-driven algorithm that determines the
                 response to query by iteratively applying a system of
                 query propagation rules. The propagation rules yield
                 precise responses for the class of distributive finite
                 data flow problems. We also describe a two-phase
                 framework variation to accurately handle
                 nondistributive problems. A performance evaluation of
                 our demand-driven approach is presented for two data
                 flow problems, namely, reaching-definitions and copy
                 constant propagation. Our experiments show that
                 demand-driven analysis performs well in practice,
                 reducing both time and space requirements when compared
                 with exhaustive analysis.},

@article{Ernst:2001ec,
	abstract = {Explicitly stated program invariants can help
                 programmers by identifying program properties that must
                 be preserved when modifying code. In practice, however,
                 these invariants are usually implicit. An alternative
                 to expecting programmers to fully annotate code with
                 invariants is to automatically infer likely invariants
                 from the program itself. This research focuses on
                 dynamic techniques for discovering invariants from
                 execution traces. \par This article reports three
                 results. First, it describes techniques for dynamically
                 discovering invariants, along with an implementation,
                 named Daikon, that embodies these techniques. Second,
                 it reports on the application of Daikon to two sets of
                 target programs. In programs from Gries's work on
                 program derivation, the system rediscovered predefined
                 invariants. In a C program lacking explicit invariants,
                 the system discovered invariants that assisted a
                 software evolution task. These experiments demonstrate
                 that, at least for small programs, invariant inference
                 is both accurate and useful. Third, it analyzes
                 scalability issues such as invariant detection runtime
                 and accuracy as functions of test suites and program
                 points instrumented.},

	abstract = {Program transformation has been advocated as a
                 potentially appropriate methodology for program
                 development. The ability to transform large programs is
                 crucial to the practicality of such an approach. This
                 paper describes research directed towards applying one
                 particular transformation method to problems of
                 increasing scale. The method adopted is that developed
                 by Burstall and Darlington, and familiarity with their
                 work is assumed. The problems which arise when
                 attempting transformation of larger scale programs are
                 discussed, and an approach to overcoming them is

                 a machine-based system which assists a user in

@article{ferguson:chaining,
	abstract = {Software testing is very labor intensive and expensive
                 and accounts for a significant portion of software
                 system development cost. If the testing process could
                 be automated, the cost of developing software could be
                 significantly reduced. Test data generation in program
                 testing is the process of identifying a set of test
                 data that satisfies a selected testing criterion, such
                 as statement coverage and branch coverage. In this
                 article we present a {\em chaining approach\/} for
                 automated software test data generation which builds on
                 the current theory of execution-oriented test data
                 generation. In the chaining approach, test data are
                 derived based on the actual execution of the program
                 under test. For many programs, the execution of the
                 selected statement may require prior execution of some
                 other statements. The existing methods of test data
                 generation may not efficiently generate test data for
                 these types of programs because they only use control
                 flow information of a program during the search
                 process. The chaining approach uses data dependence
                 analysis to guide the search process, i.e., data
                 dependence analysis automatically identifies statements
                 that affect the execution of the selected statement.
                 The chaining approach uses these statements to form a
                 sequence of statements that is to be executed prior to
                 the execution of the selected statement. The
                 experiments have shown that the chaining approach may
                 significantly improve the chances of finding test data
                 as compared to the existing methods of automated test
                 data generation.},

                         major
                         obstacles. The first is understanding the program to be

                         insuring that the unmodified parts have not been
                         accidentally impacted. Traditional methods used to
                         understand and modify a program overwhelm the
                         maintainer of
                         today's large systems. A possible solution is to modify
                         the
                         process under which maintenance is performed. The

	abstract = {In this article we present a compiler-based technique
                 to help develop correct real-time systems. The domain
                 we consider is that of multiprogrammed real-time
                 applications, in which periodic tasks control physical
                 systems via interacting with external sensors and
                 actuators. While a system is up and running, these
                 operations must be performed as specified---otherwise
                 the system may fail. Correctness depends not only on
                 each program individually, but also on the
                 time-multiplexed behavior of all of the programs
                 running together. Errors due to overloaded resources
                 are exposed very late in a development process, and
                 often at runtime. They are usually remedied by
                 human-intensive activities such as instrumentation,
                 measurement, code tuning and redesign. We describe a
                 static alternative to this process, which relies on
                 well-accepted technologies from optimizing compilers
                 and fixed-priority scheduling. Specifically, when a set
                 of tasks are found to be overloaded, a scheduling
                 analyzer determines candidate tasks to be transformed
                 via program slicing. The slicing engine decomposes each
                 of the selected tasks into two fragments: one that is
                 ``time critical'' and the other ``unobservable.'' The
                 unobservable part is then spliced to the end of the
                 time-critical code, with the external semantics being
                 maintained. The benefit is that the scheduler may
                 postpone the unobservable code beyond its original
                 deadline, which can enhance overall schedulability.
                 While the optimization is completely local, the
                 improvement is realized globally, for the entire task
                 set.},

                 data cannot be constructed that meet the test
                 requirement. This paper describes the design and
                 prototype implementation of a structural testing system
                 that uses a theorem prover to determine feasibility of
                 testing requirements and to optimize the number of test
                 cases required to achieve test coverage. Using this
                 approach, we were able to accurately and efficiently
                 determine path feasibility for moderately-sized program
                 units of production code written in a subset of Ada. On
                 these problems, the computer solutions were obtained
                 much faster and with greater accuracy than manual
                 analysis. The paper describes how we formalize test
                 criteria as control flow graph path expressions; how
                 the criteria are mapped to logic formulas; and how we
                 control the complexity of the inference task. It
                 describes the limitations of the system and proposals
                 for its improvement as well as other applications of
                 the analysis.},

@article{gouranton:dynamic,
	abstract = {Slicing analyses have been proposed for
                  different programming languages. Rather than
                  defining a new analysis from scratch for each
                  programming language, we would like to specify
                  such an analysis once for all, in a
                  language-independent way, and then specialise
                  it for different programming languages. In
                  order to achieve this goal, we propose a notion
                  of natural semantics format and a dynamic
                  slicing analysis format. The natural semantics
                  format formalises a class of natural semantics
                  and the analysis format is a generic,
                  language-independent, slicing analysis. The
                  correctness of the generic analysis is
                  established as a relation between the
                  derivation trees of the original program and
                  the slice. This generic analysis is then
                  instantiated to several programming languages
                  conforming the semantics format (an imperative
                  language, a logic programming language and a
                  functional language), yielding a dynamic
                  slicing analyser for each of these languages.},

@article{graham:fast,
	abstract = {A new algorithm for global flow analysis on reducible
                 graphs is presented. The algorithm is shown to treat a
                 very general class of function spaces. For a graph of e
                 edges, the algorithm has a worst-case time bound of 0(e
                 log e) function operations. It is also shown that in
                 programming terms, the number of operations is
                 proportional to e plus the number of exits from program
                 loops. Consequently a restriction to one-entry one-exit
                 control structures guarantees linearity. The algorithm
                 can be extended to yet larger classes of function
                 spaces and graphs by relaxing the time bound. Examples
                 are given of code improvement problems which can be
                 solved using the algorithm.},

@inproceedings{gupta:hybrid,
	abstract = {Program slicing is an effective technique for
                 narrowing the focus of attention to the relevant parts
                 of a program during the debugging process. However,
                 imprecision is a problem in static slices since they
                 are based on all executions that reach a given program
                 point rather than the specific execution under which
                 the program is being debugged. Dynamic slices are
                 precise but require a large amount of run time overhead
                 due to the tracing information that is collected during
                 the program's execution. We present a general approach
                 for improving the precision and quality of static
                 slices by incorporating dynamic information in static
                 slicing, enabling the computation of hybrid slices. The
                 technique exploits dynamic information that is readily
                 available during debugging, namely breakpoint
                 information and the dynamic call graph. The precision
                 of static slicing is improved in hybrid slicing by more
                 accurately estimating the potential paths taken by the
                 program. The breakpoints and call/return points, used
                 as reference points, divide the execution path into
                 intervals. By associating each statement in the slice
                 with an execution interval, hybrid slicing technique
                 also improves the quality of slicing information.},

@inproceedings{horwitz:demand,
	abstract = {An exhaustive dataflow analysis algorithm associates
                 with each point in a program a set of ``dataflow
                 facts'' that are guaranteed to hold whenever that point
                 is reached during program execution. By contrast, a
                 {\em demand} dataflow analysis algorithm determines
                 whether a single given dataflow fact holds at a single
                 given point. This paper presents a new demand algorithm
                 for interprocedural dataflow analysis. The new
                 algorithm has three important properties:
                 \begin{itemize} \item It provides precise (meet over
                 all interprocedurally valid paths) solutions to a large
                 class of problems. \item It has a polynomial worst-case
                 cost for both a single demand and a sequence of all
                 possible demands. \item The worst-case total cost of
                 the sequence of all possible demands is no worse than
                 the worst-case cost of a single run of the current best
                 exhaustive algorithm. \end{itemize}},

                 fine-grained, distinguishing dependences that are due
                 to different variables. The program dependence graph
                 (PDG) satisfies neither of these criteria. We present a
                 new form of dependence graph that satisfies both, while
                 retaining the advantages of the PDG: it is easy to
                 construct and allows program slicing to be implemented
                 as a simple graph traversal. We define 'chopping', a
                 generalization of slicing that can express most of its
                 variants, and show that, using our dependence graph, it
                 produces more accurate results than algorithms based
                 directly on the PDG.},

	abstract = {A dynamic program slice is an executable part of a
           program whose behavior is identical, for the same
           program input, to that of an original program with
           respect to a variable(s) of interest at some execution
           position. In the existing dynamic slicing tools,
           dynamic slices are represented in the textual form,
           i.e., a dynamic slice is displayed to programmers as a
           subprogram or as highlighted statements in the original
           program. Although dynamic slicing does narrow the size
           of the program, the textual representation of a dynamic
           slice does not provide much guidance in the
           understanding of program execution. During dynamic
           slice computation different types of information are
           computed and then discarded. In this paper we propose
           new dynamic-slicing related features that exploit this
           information for the purpose of understanding of program
           execution. These features were implemented in the
           dynamic slicing tool that is used to improve the
           process of program understanding.},

@inproceedings{korel:large,
	abstract = {Program slicing transforms a large program into a
                 smaller one that contains only statements relevant to
                 the computation of a given function. It has been shown
                 that program slicing can be useful in program
                 understanding. Traditionally, program slices are
                 represented in the textual form. Although slicing does
                 narrow the size of the program, the textual
                 representation of a slice does not provide much
                 guidance in the understanding of large programs. In
                 this paper we present program slicing concepts on the
                 module level that allow for better understanding of
                 program slices of large programs and their executions.
                 These concepts have been developed for static and
                 dynamic program slicing and are combined with different
                 methods of visualization to guide programmers in the
                 process of program understanding. The presented
                 concepts have been implemented in the slicing tool that
                 is used to investigate the usefulness of these concepts

@inproceedings{korel:black-box,
	abstract = {Developers have to identify properties of COTS
           components to properly integrate them with a system
           under development, but COTS components are typically
           ``black boxes'' because their source code is not
           available. In this paper we present an approach that
           can be used in black-box understanding of COTS
           components. The major objective is to reduce the effort
           required to reveal component properties by partially
           automating interface probing. A developer provides a
           full, or partial, description of a component property
           together with a search scope where assertions are used
           to describe component properties. Based on this
           information, a search engine automatically searches for
           component inputs on which the component property is
           revealed using a combination of existing automated test
           generation methods for black-box testing and for
           white-box testing. Our initial experience has shown
           that this approach may be a cost-effective way of

@inproceedings{koschke99incremental,
	abstract = {Atomic components are sets of related variables,
                 types, and subprograms, e.g., abstract data types and
                 objects. Many techniques exist to detect them
                 automatically. However, as an evaluation has shown,
                 none of them has the precision needed. One approach to
                 achieve a higher precision is to integrate the user
                 into the detection cycle. This paper describes a method
                 in which computer and human work together to find
                 atomic components. Furthermore, it discusses how the
                 techniques can be enhanced to work incrementally, which
                 is needed if they are to be integrated with this
                 method. Moreover, it proposes ways of combining the
                 techniques within this interactive method.},

@inproceedings{livadas:program,
	abstract = {It is generally recognized that one of the reasons
                 that software maintenance is so costly is that each
                 modification to a program must take into account the
                 numerous complex interrelationships in the existing
                 software; an understanding of program dependences is
                 fundamental to efficient software change. Such
                 dependences can be of the following types, data flow,
                 calling, and functional dependences. Furthermore, as
                 the software community gradually begins to move toward
                 a more object-oriented perspective on software
                 development, it will become increasingly important to
                 be able to 'objectify' existing software systems.
                 Successful maintenance requires precise knowledge of
                 the data items in a system, the ways these items are
                 created and modified, and their relationships between
                 one another. In this paper the authors address these
                 two issues. First, they will discuss three methods of
                 identifying objects the first two of which were
                 suggested by Liu and Wilde; the third method is one
                 that is proposed in this paper and is based on the
                 determination of the receiver of a procedure. We
                 believe that the latter method is one that is more
                 natural and precise than the former two. Second,
                 algorithms that perform precise interprocedural
                 flow-sensitive dependency analysis, as well as
                 algorithms that identify 'objects', are introduced.
                 Furthermore, the internal program representation that
                 we emply, the parse-tree-based system dependence graph
                 (SDG), is briefly discussed. Finally, a unique tool
                 that we have developed is presented that accepts a
                 subset of ANSI C (or Pascal) as input and which
                 implements all algorithms discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Automatic parallelization of real FORTRAN programs
                 does not live up to users expectations yet, and
                 dependence analysis algorithms which either produce too
                 many false dependences or are too slow to contribute
                 significantly to this. In this paper we introduce
                 dataflow dependence analysis algorithm which exactly
                 computes value-based dependence relations for program
                 fragments in which all subscripts, loop bound and IF
                 conditions are affine. Our algorithm also computes good
                 affine approximations of dependence relations for
                 non-affine program fragments. Actually, we do not know
                 about any other algorithm which can compute better
                 approximations. And our algorithm is efficient too,
                 because it is lazy. When searching for write statements
                 that supply values used by a given read statement, it
                 starts with statements which are lexicographically
                 close to the read statement in iteration space. Then if
                 some of the read statement instances are not
                 ``satisfied'' with these close writes, the algorithm
                 broadens its search scope by looking into more distant
                 writes. The search scope keeps broadening until all
                 read instances are satisfied or no write candidates are
                 left. We timed our algorithm on several benchmark
                 programs and the timing results suggest that our
                 algorithm is fast enough to be used in commercial
                 compilers---it usually takes 5 to 15 percent of f77 -02
                 compilation time to analyze a program. Most programs in
                 the 100-line range take less than 1 second to analyze
                 on a SUN SPARCstation IPX.},

                 libraries grow in size, it becomes increasingly

                 with informal retrieval algorithms. In this paper, we

@article{mili:survey,
	abstract = {The study of storage and retrieval methods of software
                 assets in software libraries gives rise to a number of
                 paradoxes: While this subject has been under
                 investigation for nearly two decades, it still remains
                 an active area of research in software reuse and
                 software engineering; this can be explained by the
                 observation that new technologies (such as the
                 internet, the world wide web, object-oriented
                 programming) keep opening new opportunities for better
                 asset packaging, better library organizations, and
                 larger scale libraries---thereby posing new technical
                 challenges. Also, while many sophisticated solutions
                 have been proposed to this problem, the state of the
                 practice in software reuse is characterized by the use
                 of ad-hoc, low-tech methods; this can be explained by
                 the observation that most existing solutions are either
                 too ineffective to be useful or too intractable to be
                 usable. Finally, while it is difficult to imagine a
                 successful software reuse program without a
                 sophisticated, well-tuned, systematic procedure for
                 software component storage and retrieval, it seems many
                 successful software reuse experiments rely on trivial
                 methods of component storage and retrieval; this can be
                 explained by the observation that, in the current state
                 of the practice, software libraries are not the
                 bottleneck of the software reuse process. This paper
                 presents a survey of methods of storage and retrieval
                 of software assets in software libraries. In addition
                 to a review of existing research efforts, the paper
                 makes two contributions. First, a definition of
                 (presumably) orthogonal attributes of storage and
                 retrieval methods; these attributes are used, in turn,
                 to classify existing methods into six broad classes.
                 Second, a definition of (presumably) orthogonal
                 assessment criteria, which include technical,
                 managerial and human factors; these criteria afford us
                 an exhaustive and uniform basis for assessing and
                 comparing individual methods and classes of methods.},

                 abstraction mechanisms to structure and represent the
                 information accumulated during the development process.
                 The objects and relationships of the graph model
                 represent system components and their dependencies. The
                 objects can be arranged in aggregation and
                 generalization hierarchies. The Rigi editor assists the
                 designers, programmers, integrators, and maintainers in
                 defining, manipulating, exploring, and understanding,
                 the structure of large, integrated, evolving software
                 systems. Rigi was designed to address three of the most
                 difficult problems in the area of
                 programming-in-the-large: the mastery of the structural
                 complexity of large software systems, the effective
                 presentation of development information, and the
                 definition of procedures for checking and maintaining
                 the completeness, consistency, and traceability of
                 system descriptions. Thus, the major objective of Rigi
                 is to effectively represent and manipulate the building
                 blocks of a software system and their myriad
                 dependencies, thereby aiding the development phases of

@inproceedings{nilsson:lazy,
	abstract = {Lazy functional languages have non-strict semantics
                 and are purely declarative, i.e. they support the
                 notaion of referential transparency and are devoid of
                 side effects. Traditional debugging techniques are,
                 however, not suited for lazy functiona languages since
                 computations generally do not take place in the order
                 one might expect. Since {\em algorithmic debugging}
                 allows the user to concerntrate on the declarative
                 aspects of program semantics, and will
                 semi-automatically find functions containing bugs, we
                 propose to use this tecnique for debugging lazy
                 functional programs. Our earlier work showed that this
                 is a promising approach. However, the current version
                 of our debugger has severe implementational problems,
                 e.g. too large trace size and too many questions asked.
                 This paper suggests a number of techniques for
                 overcoming these problems, at least partially. The key
                 techniques are {\em immediate strictification} and {\em

                 presented and used to evaluate several dependence-based
                 software testing, debugging, and maintenance
                 techniques. Two generalizations of control and data
                 flow dependence, called weak and strong syntactic
                 dependence, are introduced and related to a concept
                 called semantic dependence. Semantic dependence models
                 the ability of a program statement to affect the
                 execution behavior of other statements. It is shown
                 that weak syntactic dependence is a necessary but not
                 sufficient condition for semantic dependence and that
                 strong syntactic dependence is necessary but not
                 sufficient condition for a restricted form of semantic
                 dependence that is finitely demonstrated. These results

                 dependences, to controvert others, and to suggest new

@inproceedings{reps:chopping,
	abstract = {The notion of a {\em program slice}, originally
                 introduced by Mark Weiser, is a fundamental operation
                 for addressing many software-engineering problems,
                 including program understanding, debugging,
                 maintenance, testing, and merging. A slice determines
                 either all program elements that might affect a given
                 element (``backward slicing'') or all elements that
                 could be affected by a given element (``forward
                 slicing''). Jackson and Rollins introduced a related
                 operation, called {\em program chopping}, which is a
                 kind of ``filtered'' slice: Chopping answers questions
                 of the form ``What are all the program elements $v$
                 that serve to transmit effects from a given source
                 element $s$ to a given target element $t$?'' However,
                 Jackson and Rollins define only a limited form of
                 chopping: Among other restrictions, they impose the
                 restriction that $s$ and $t$ be in the same procedure.
                 This paper solves the unrestricted interprocedural
                 chopping problem, as well as a variety of other useful
                 variants of interprocedural chopping.},

                 perform a certain kind of program-specialization
                 operation. We show that the specialization operation
                 that slicing performs is different from the
                 specialization operations performed by algorithms for
                 partial evaluation, supercompilation, bifurcation, and
                 deforestation. To study the relationship between
                 slicing and these operations in a simplified setting,
                 we consider the problem of slicing functional programs.
                 We identify two different goals for what we mean by
                 ``slicing a functional program'' and give algorithms
                 that correspond to each of them.},

	abstract = {The paper shows how a large class of interprocedural
                 dataflow-analysis problems can be solved precisely in
                 polynomial time by transforming them into a special
                 kind of graph-reachability problem. The only
                 restrictions are that the set of dataflow facts must be
                 a finite set, and that the dataflow functions must
                 distribute over the confluence operator (either union
                 or intersection). This class of probable problems
                 includes---but is not limited to---the classical
                 separable problems (also known as ``gen/kill'' or
                 ``bit-vector'' problems)---\emph{e.g.}, reaching
                 definitions, available expressions, and live variables.
                 In addition, the class of problems that our techniques
                 handle includes many non-separable problems, including
                 truly-live variables, copy constant propagation, and
                 possibly-uninitialized variables. Results are reported
                 from a preliminary experimental study of C programs
                 (for the problem of finding possibly-uninitialized
                 variables).},

	abstract = {The author describes a software tool that provides
                 heuristic modularization advice for improving existing
                 code. A heuristic design similarity measure is defined,
                 based on the Parnas' information hiding principle. The
                 measure supports two services: clustering, which
                 identifies groups of related procedures, and maverick
                 analysis, which identifies individual procedures that
                 appear to be in the wrong module. The tool has already
                 provided useful advice in several real programming
                 projects. The tool will soon incorporate an automatic
                 tuning method, which allows the tool to learn from its
                 mistakes, adapting its advice to the architect's
                 preferences. A preliminary experiment demonstrates that
                 the automatically tuned similarity function can assign
                 procedures to modules very accurately.},

@inproceedings{krone:inference,
	abstract = {The authors apply mathematical concept analysis to the
                 problem of infering configuration structures from
                 existing source code. Concept analysis has been
                 developed by German mathematicans over the last years;
                 it can be seen as a discrete analogon to Fourier
                 analysis. Based on this theory, the authors' tool will
                 accept source code, where configuration-specific
                 statements are controlled by the preprocessor. The
                 algorithm will compute a so-called concept lattice,
                 which - when visually displayed - allows remarkable
                 insight into the structure and properties of possible
                 configurations. The lattice not only displays
                 fine-grained dependencies between configuration
                 threads, but also visualizes the overall quality of
                 configuration structures according to software
                 engineering principles. The paper presents a short
                 introduction to concept analysis, as well as
                 experimental results on various programs.},

@inproceedings{snelting:assessing,
	abstract = {We apply mathematical concept analysis in order to
                 modularize legacy code. By analysing the relation
                 between procedures and global variables, a so-called
                 concept lattice is constructed. The paper explains how
                 module structures show up in the lattice, and how the
                 lattice can be used to assess cohesion and coupling
                 between module candidates. Certain algebraic
                 decompositions of the lattice can lead to automatic
                 generation of modularization proposals. The method is
                 applied to several examples written in Modula-2,
                 Fortran, and Cobol; among them a >100 kloc aerodynamics

	abstract = {Mutation analysis is a powerful technique for
                 assessing and improving the quality of test data used
                 to unit test software. Unfortunately, current automated
                 mutation analysis systems suffer from severe
                 performance problems. This paper presents a new method
                 for performing mutation analysis that uses
                 \emph{program schemata} to encode all mutants for a
                 program into one \emph{metaprogram}, which is
                 subsequently compiled and run at speeds substantially
                 higher than achieved by previous interpretive systems.
                 Preliminary performance improvements of over 300 are
                 reported. This method has the additional advantages of
                 being easier to implement than interpretive systems,
                 being simpler to port across a wide range of hardware
                 and software platforms, and using the same compiler and
                 run-time support system that is used during development
                 and/or deployment.},

@article{venkatesh:experimental,
	abstract = {{\em Program slicing\/} is a program analysis
                 technique that has been studied in the context of
                 several different applications in the construction,
                 optimization, maintenance, testing, and debugging of
                 programs. Algorithms are available for constructing
                 slices for a particular execution of a program (dynamic
                 slices), as well as to approximate a subset of the
                 behavior over all possible executions of a program
                 (static slices). However, these algorithms have been
                 studied only in the context of small abstract
                 languages. Program slicing is bound to remain an
                 academic exercise unless one can not only demonstrate
                 the feasibility of building a slicer for nontrivial
                 programs written in a real programming language, but
                 also verify that a type of slice is sufficiently thin,
                 on the average, for the application for which it is
                 chosen. In this article, we present results from using
                 {\em SLICE}, a dynamic program slicer for C programs,
                 designed and implemented to experiment with several
                 different kinds of program slices and to study them
                 both qualitatively and quantitatively. Several
                 application programs, ranging in size (i.e., number of
                 lines of code) over two orders of magnitude, were
                 sliced exhaustively to obtain average worst-case
                 metrics for the size of program slices.},

@inproceedings{walker:initial,
	abstract = {The principle of separation of concerns has long been
		 used by software engineers to manage the complexity of
		 software system development. Programming languages help
		 software engineers explicitly maintain the separation
		 of some concerns in code. As another step towards
		 increasing the scope of concerns that can be captured
		 cleanly within the code, Kiczales and colleagues have
		 introduced aspect-oriented programming. In
		 aspect-oriented programming, explicit language support
		 is provided to help modularize design decisions that
		 cross-cut a functionally-decomposed program.
		 Aspect-oriented programming is intended to make it
		 easier to reason about, develop, and maintain certain
		 kinds of application code. To investigate these claims,
		 we conducted two exploratory experiments that
		 considered the impact of aspect-oriented programming,
		 as found in AspectJ version 0.1, on two common
		 programming activities: debugging and change. Our
		 experimental results provide insights into the
		 usefulness and usability of aspect-oriented
		 programming. Our results also raise questions about the
		 characteristics of the interface between aspects and
		 functionallydecomposed core code that are necessary to
		 accrue programming benefits. Most notably, the
		 separation provided by aspect-oriented programming
		 seems most helpful when the interface is narrow (i.e.,
		 the separation is more complete); partial separation
		 does not necessarily provide partial benefit.},

@inproceedings{weise:value,
	abstract = {The \emph{value dependence graph} (VDG) is a sparse
                 dataflow-like representation that simplifies program
                 analysis and transformation. It is a functional
                 representation that represents control flow as data
                 flow and makes explicit all machine quantities, such as
                 stores and I/O channels. We are developing a compiler
                 that builds a VDG representing a program, analyzes and
                 transforms the VDG, then produces a control flow graph
                 (CFG) [ASU86] from the optimized VDG. This framework
                 simplifies transformations and improves upon several
                 published results. For example, it enables more
                 powerful code motion than [CLZ86, FOW87], eliminates as
                 many redundancies as [AWZ88, RWZ88] (except for
                 redundant loops), and provides important information to
                 the code scheduler [BR91]. We exhibit a fast, one-pass
                 method for elimination of partial redundancies that
                 never performs redundant code motion [KFS92, DS93] and
                 is simpler than the classical [MR79, Dha91] or SSA
                 [RWZ88] methods. These results accrue from eliminating
                 the CFG from the analysis/transformation phases and
                 using \emph{demand dependences} in preference to
                 control dependences.},

@article{yhr:program-integration,
	abstract = {Given a program \emph{Base} and two variants, \emph{A}
                 and \emph{B}, each created by modifying separate copies
                 of \emph{Base}, the goal of program integration is to
                 determine whether the modifications interfere, and if
                 they do not, to create an integrated program that
                 includes both sets of changes as well as the portions
                 of \emph{Base} preserved in both variants. Text-based
                 integration techniques, such as the one used by the
                 Unix \emph{diff3} utility, are obviously unsatisfactory
                 because one has no guarantees about how the execution
                 behavior of the integrated program relates to the
                 behaviors of \emph{Base}, \emph{A}, and \emph{B}. The
                 first program-integration algorithm to provide such
                 guarantees was developed by Horwitz et
                 al.~\cite{1989:toplas:horwitz}. However, a limitation
                 of that algorithm is that it incorporates no notion of
                 semantics-preserving transformations. This limitation
                 causes the algorithm to be overly conservative in its
                 definition of interference. For example, if one variant
                 changes the \emph{way} a computation is performed
                 (without changing the values computed) while the other
                 variant adds code that uses the result of the
                 computation, the algorithm would classify those changes
                 as interfering. This paper describes a new integration
                 algorithm that is able to accommodate
                 semantics-preserving transformations.},
