\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We evaluated 4 state-of-the-art techniques in DL fault localisation on a  meticulously tailored set of real and artificial faulty models to asses the advances in the area. Our findings show that all of the evaluated approaches are able to locate a certain percentage of faults. However, all are quite far from the best possible results. \dfd exhibited the highest effectiveness, followed by \NL and \UM. \DD exhibited relatively poor performance. On the positive side, all proposed techniques are stable across multiple runs and do not require substantial resources. According to our findings, future work in the area of DNN fault identification and localisation should focus on improving the accuracy of the proposed techniques. This suggests that it is highly unlikely that existing approaches for DNN tuning and repair might significantly benefit from the combination with the evaluated localisation tools.
