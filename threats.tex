\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:threats}

\subsubsection{Construct}
Threats to construct validity are due to the measurement of the
effectiveness of the fault localisation tools and the interpretation of the tools' output. We use the simple count of the matches between fault localisation results and the ground truth, along with the AJ metric that calculates the percentage of the matches from the total number of faults in the ground truth.

\subsubsection{Internal}
Threats to the internal validity of the study lie in the selection of evaluated approaches. To the best of our knowledge, we considered all state-of-the-art techniques and adopted their publicly available implementations.

\subsubsection{External}
To address the threats to external validity, we carefully selected faults of both artificial and real nature, covering a set of diverse subjects for the evaluation of FL techniques. Nevertheless, replicating our study on additional subjects would be useful to corroborate our findings.
